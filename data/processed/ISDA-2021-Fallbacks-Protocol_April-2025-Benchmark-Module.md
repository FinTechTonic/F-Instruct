# 2. **Amendments to Protocol Covered Documents incorporating the 2006 ISDA Definitions**

If a Protocol Covered Document incorporates the 2006 ISDA Definitions and references a Relevant Benchmark, the version of the 2006 ISDA Definitions so incorporated shall be amended in accordance with:

If a Protocol Covered Document that incorporates the 2006 ISDA Definitions and references a Relevant Benchmark is a Protocol Covered Master Agreement, any reference to a term defined in the 2006 ISDA Definitions in a Confirmation which supplements, forms part of and is subject to that Protocol Covered Master Agreement shall be a reference to the term as defined in the 2006 ISDA Definitions as amended in accordance with the relevant 2006 Definitions Amendments and the following additional amendments in this paragraph 2.

The following additional amendments shall also be made to each such Protocol Covered Document:

- (a) Section 7.1(j)(viii) ("IDR-JIBOR-Reuters") is amended by deleting it in its entirety and restating it as follows:

Subject to the immediately succeeding paragraph below (entitled '*Index Cessation Effective Date or Administrator/Benchmark Event Date with respect to JIBOR*'), if JIBOR for a period of the Designated Maturity in respect of the day for which it is required is not published on the LSEG Screen JIBOR Page nor otherwise provided by the Administrator of JIBOR and published by an authorized distributor or by the Administrator of JIBOR by either the Reset Date or such other date on which JIBOR is required, then Temporary Non-Publication Fallback – Alternative Rate will apply.

### *Index Cessation Effective Date or Administrator/Benchmark Event Date with respect to JIBOR*

If an Index Cessation Event or Administrator/Benchmark Event with respect to JIBOR occurs, the rate for a Fixing Day occurring on or after the Applicable Fallback Effective Date with respect to JIBOR will be determined as if references to "IDR-JIBOR-Reuters" were references to Fallback Rate (INDONIA) for the 'Original IBOR Rate Record Day' that corresponds to the Fixing Day, as most recently provided or published as at 22:00, Jakarta time on the related Fallback Observation Day. If neither Bloomberg Index Services Limited (or a successor provider as approved and/or appointed by ISDA from time to time) provides, nor authorized distributors publish, Fallback Rate (INDONIA) for that 'Original IBOR Rate Record Day' at, or prior to, 22:00, Jakarta time on the related Fallback Observation Day and an Applicable Fallback Effective Date with respect to Fallback Rate (INDONIA) has not occurred, then the rate for the Reset Date will be Fallback Rate (INDONIA) as most recently provided or published at that time for the most recent 'Original IBOR Rate Record Day', notwithstanding that such day does not correspond to the Fixing Day.

### *Fallback Index Cessation Effective Date or Administrator/Benchmark Event Date with respect to Fallback Rate (INDONIA)*

If a Fallback Index Cessation Event or Administrator/Benchmark Event with respect to Fallback Rate (INDONIA) occurs, the rate for a Reset Date which relates to a Calculation Period (or any Compounding Period included in that Calculation Period) in respect of which the Fallback Observation Day occurs on or after the Applicable Fallback Effective Date with respect to Fallback Rate (INDONIA) will be INDONIA, to which the Calculation Agent shall apply the most recently published spread, as at the Applicable Fallback Effective Date with respect to Fallback Rate (INDONIA), referred to in the definition of "Fallback Rate (INDONIA)" after making such adjustments to INDONIA as are necessary to account for any difference in term structure or tenor of INDONIA by comparison to Fallback Rate (INDONIA) and by reference to the Bloomberg IBOR Fallback Rate Adjustments Rule Book.

#### *Temporary Non-Publication with respect to INDONIA*

If neither the Administrator nor authorized distributors provide or publish INDONIA, then, subject to the immediately succeeding paragraph below (entitled '*Fallback Index Cessation Effective Date or Administrator/Benchmark Event Date with respect to INDONIA*'), in respect of any day for which INDONIA is required, references to INDONIA will be deemed to be references to the last provided or published INDONIA.

#### *Fallback Index Cessation Effective Date or Administrator/Benchmark Event Date with respect to INDONIA*

If an Applicable Fallback Effective Date occurs with respect to each of Fallback Rate (INDONIA) and INDONIA, then the rate for a Reset Date which relates to a Calculation Period (or any Compounding Period included in that Calculation Period) in respect of which the Fallback Observation Day occurs on or after the Applicable Fallback Effective Date with respect to Fallback Rate (INDONIA) (or, if later, the Applicable Fallback Effective Date with respect to INDONIA) will be the IDR Recommended Rate, to which the Calculation Agent shall apply the most recently published spread, as at the Applicable Fallback Effective Date with respect to Fallback Rate (INDONIA), referred to in the definition of "Fallback Rate (INDONIA)" after making such adjustments to the IDR Recommended Rate as are necessary to account for any difference in term structure or tenor of the IDR Recommended Rate by comparison to Fallback Rate (INDONIA) and by reference to the Bloomberg IBOR Fallback Rate Adjustments Rule Book.

#### *Temporary Non-Publication with respect to IDR Recommended Rate*

If there is an IDR Recommended Rate before the end of the first Jakarta Banking Day following the Applicable Fallback Effective Date with respect to Fallback Rate (INDONIA) (or, if later, the end of the first Jakarta Banking Day following the Applicable Fallback Effective Date with respect to INDONIA) but neither the Administrator nor authorized distributors provide or publish the IDR Recommended Rate, then, subject to the immediately succeeding paragraph below (entitled '*No IDR Recommended Rate or Fallback Index Cessation Effective Date or Administrator/Benchmark Event Date with respect to IDR Recommended Rate*'), in respect of any day for which the IDR Recommended Rate is required, references to the IDR Recommended Rate will be deemed to be references to the last provided or published IDR Recommended Rate. However, if there is no last provided or published IDR Recommended Rate, then in respect of any day for which the IDR Recommended Rate is required, references to the IDR Recommended Rate will be deemed to be references to the last provided or published INDONIA.

*No IDR Recommended Rate or Fallback Index Cessation Effective Date or Administrator/Benchmark Event Date with respect to IDR Recommended Rate*

If:

- (A) there is no IDR Recommended Rate before the end of the first Jakarta Banking Day following the Applicable Fallback Effective Date with respect to Fallback Rate (INDONIA) (or, if later, the end of the first Jakarta Banking Day following the Applicable Fallback Effective Date with respect to INDONIA); or
- (B) there is an IDR Recommended Rate and an Applicable Fallback Effective Date subsequently occurs with respect to it,

then the rate for a Reset Date which relates to a Calculation Period (or any Compounding Period included in that Calculation Period) in respect of which the Fallback Observation Day occurs on or after the Applicable Fallback Effective Date with respect to Fallback Rate (INDONIA) (or, if later, the Applicable Fallback Effective Date with respect to INDONIA) or the Applicable Fallback Effective Date with respect to the IDR Recommended Rate (as applicable) will be determined in accordance with the Generic Fallback Provisions, provided that paragraph (ii)(B) of Section 7.12(b) (*Application of Alternative Continuation Fallbacks*) shall not apply.

# *No Continuation Amendment*

If no Continuation Amendment can be made under any of the applicable Alternative Continuation Fallbacks by Close of Business on the Cut-off Date, then the rate for a Reset Date which relates to a Calculation Period (or any Compounding Period included in that Calculation Period) in respect of which the Fallback Observation Day occurs on or after the Applicable Fallback Effective Date with respect to Fallback Rate (INDONIA) (or, if later, the Applicable Fallback Effective Date with respect to INDONIA) or the Applicable Fallback Effective Date with respect to the IDR Recommended Rate (as applicable) will be determined in accordance with Calculation Agent Alternative Rate Determination.

The provisions set out in this Rate Option are, without limitation, subject to Section 7.8 (*Acknowledgement Regarding any Modification to a Floating Rate Option*), Section 7.9 (*Fallbacks for key IBOR Rate Options for certain Calculation Periods to which "Linear Interpolation" is specified to be applicable*) and Section 8.5 (*Discontinued Rates Maturities*).

If the rate for a Reset Date is determined by reference to Fallback Rate (INDONIA), Section 7.6 (*Corrections to Published and Displayed Rates*) shall not apply.

For the purposes of this Rate Option and references to Fallback Observation Day, references to "Business Days" will be to those Business Days applicable for the purposes of the payment obligation which is calculated by reference to this Rate Option and references to an "Original IBOR Rate Record Day" are to that term as used on the Fallback Rate (INDONIA) Screen.

# 5. **Amendments to certain Protocol Covered Documents that reference a Relevant Benchmark**

If a Protocol Covered Document is of the type described in subparagraph (c) of, respectively, the definition of Protocol Covered Confirmation, Protocol Covered Credit Support Document or Protocol Covered Master Agreement and, in each case, includes a reference to a Relevant Benchmark pursuant to which the Relevant Benchmark is required for any determination, and:

- (a) (i) the Relevant Benchmark for the relevant tenor (if applicable), in respect of the Reset Date, is not published by the Administrator or an authorized distributor and is not otherwise provided by the Administrator by either:
	- (A) the later of (I) the Reset Date and (II) the Fixing Day; or
	- (B) such other date on which the Relevant Benchmark is required; and

(ii) an Index Cessation Effective Date or an Administrator/Benchmark Event Date with respect to the Relevant Benchmark has not occurred,

then, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the rate for any day for which the Relevant Benchmark is required will be:

- (I) a rate formally recommended for use by the Administrator; or
- (II) a rate formally recommended for use by the supervisor or competent authority that is responsible for supervising the Relevant Benchmark or the Administrator, or by a committee officially endorsed or convened by a supervisor or competent authority that is responsible for supervising the Relevant Benchmark or the Administrator,

in each case, during the period of non-publication of the Relevant Benchmark and for so long as an Index Cessation Effective Date or an Administrator/Benchmark Event Date has not occurred. If a rate described in subparagraph (I) above is available, that rate shall apply. If no such rate is available but a rate described in subparagraph (II) above is available, that rate shall apply. If neither a rate described in subparagraph (I) above nor a rate described in subparagraph (II) above is available, the rate for the Reset Date will be determined in accordance with Calculation Agent Alternative Rate Determination.

(b) subject to paragraph 5(c) below, an Index Cessation Event or Administrator/Benchmark Event with respect to the Relevant Benchmark occurs, then the reference to the Relevant Benchmark will be deemed to be a reference to the Applicable Fallback Rate from and including each Fixing Day that falls on or after the Applicable Fallback Effective Date, provided that:

(i) if the Relevant Benchmark is JIBOR or JIBAR and the Applicable Fallback Rate is, respectively, Fallback Rate (INDONIA) or Fallback Rate (ZARONIA), then the rate for a Fixing Day occurring on or after the Applicable Fallback Effective Date with respect to the Relevant Benchmark will be the Applicable Fallback Rate for the 'Original IBOR Rate Record Day' that corresponds to the Fixing Day, as most recently provided or published as at the Applicable Cut-off Time on the related Fallback Observation Day. If neither the provider of the Applicable Fallback Rate (or a successor provider as approved and/or appointed by ISDA from time to time) provides, nor authorized distributors publish, the Applicable Fallback Rate for that 'Original IBOR Rate Record Day' at, or prior to, the Applicable Cut-off Time on the related Fallback Observation Day and an Applicable Fallback Effective Date with respect to that Applicable Fallback Rate has not occurred, then the rate for the Reset Date will be the Applicable Fallback Rate as most recently provided or published at the Applicable Cut-off Time on the Fallback Observation Day for the most recent 'Original IBOR Rate Record Day', notwithstanding that such day does not correspond to the Fixing Day;

(ii) if (A) the Applicable Fallback Rate is INDONIA, the IDR Recommended Rate (if there is such a rate before the end of the first Jakarta Business Day following the Applicable Fallback Effective Date with respect to Fallback Rate (INDONIA) or, if later, INDONIA), ZARONIA or the ZAR Recommended Rate (if there is such a rate before the end of the first Johannesburg Business Day following the Applicable Fallback Effective Date with respect to Fallback Rate (ZARONIA) or, if later, ZARONIA), (B) neither the Administrator nor authorized distributors provide or publish that Applicable Fallback Rate and (C) an Applicable Fallback Effective Date with respect to that Applicable Fallback Rate has not occurred, then, in respect of any day for which that Applicable Fallback Rate is required, references to that Applicable Fallback Rate will be deemed to be references to the last provided or published Applicable Fallback Rate. However, if (I) the Applicable Fallback Rate is the IDR Recommended Rate or the ZAR Recommended Rate and (II) there is no such last provided or published IDR Recommended Rate or ZAR Recommended Rate, as applicable, then, in respect of any day for which the IDR Recommended Rate is required, references to the IDR Recommended Rate will be deemed to be references to the last provided or published INDONIA and, in respect of any day for which the ZAR Recommended Rate is required, references to the ZAR Recommended Rate will be deemed to be references to the last provided or published ZARONIA; and

(iii) if the Applicable Fallback Rate is the SARB Policy Rate, in respect of any day for which the SARB Policy Rate is required, references to the SARB Policy Rate will be deemed to be references to the last provided or published SARB Policy Rate as at close of business in Johannesburg on that day.

For the purposes of this paragraph 5(b), references to an "Original IBOR Rate Record Day" are to that term as used on the Fallback Rate Screen.

(c) if the Relevant Benchmark is JIBOR or JIBAR and:

(i) the determination for which the Relevant Benchmark is required is ordinarily made by reference to linear interpolation between two rates, each of which is based on the Relevant Benchmark, then (notwithstanding paragraph 5(b) above) the provisions of Section 6.10 (*Interpolation*) and Section 9.105.1 (*Specified IBOR Floating Rate Options – Linear Interpolation following Permanent Discontinuation of a Relevant Tenor*) of the 2021 Definitions shall apply, provided that the Calculation Agent shall make such adaptations as are reasonable and necessary to the provisions of Section 6.10 (*Interpolation*) and Section 9.105.1 (*Specified IBOR Floating Rate Options – Linear Interpolation following Permanent Discontinuation of a Relevant Tenor*) of the 2021 Definitions in order to apply them to the relevant Protocol Covered Document;

(ii) the Relevant Benchmark or Applicable Fallback Rate is to be determined by reference to one or more rates, at least one of which has been permanently discontinued, and at least two Relevant Benchmark or Applicable Fallback Rate (as applicable) tenors, at least one of which is shorter than the tenor in respect of which the Relevant Benchmark or Applicable Fallback Rate (as applicable) is to be determined and at least one of which is longer than the tenor in respect of which the Relevant Benchmark or Applicable Fallback Rate (as applicable) is to be determined, have not been permanently discontinued, then the provisions of Section 6.11 (*Discontinued Rates Maturities*) and Section 6.12 (*Certain Definitions and Provisions Relating to Discontinued Rates*  *Maturities*) of the 2021 Definitions shall apply and reference therein to a 'Floating Rate Option' shall be to the Relevant Benchmark or Applicable Fallback Rate (as applicable), provided that the Calculation Agent shall make such adaptations as are reasonable and necessary to the provisions of Sections 6.11 (*Discontinued Rates Maturities*) and 6.12 (*Certain Definitions and Provisions Relating to Discontinued Rates Maturities*) of the 2021 Definitions in order to apply them to the relevant Protocol Covered Document;

(iii) the Relevant Benchmark or Applicable Fallback Rate is to be determined by reference to a tenor of the Relevant Benchmark or Applicable Fallback Rate (as applicable) which has been permanently discontinued, and there are either no shorter or no longer tenors in respect of the Relevant Benchmark or Applicable Fallback Rate (as applicable) which have not been permanently discontinued, then an Index Cessation Event shall be deemed to have occurred with respect to the Relevant Benchmark or Applicable Fallback Rate (as applicable) and the Index Cessation Effective Date shall be the first date on which the Relevant Benchmark or Applicable Fallback Rate (as applicable) in the relevant tenor is permanently unavailable or, if later, the first date on which there is either no such shorter or no such longer tenor;

(iv) in the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of subparagraph 5(c)(ii) or subparagraph 5(c)(iii) above and the provisions of subparagraph 5(c)(i) above, subparagraph 5(c)(i) above shall prevail; and

(v) in the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of subparagraph 5(c)(ii) or subparagraph 5(c)(iii) above and paragraph 5(b) above (including any terms used in paragraph 5(b) above and defined below), subparagraph 5(c)(ii) or subparagraph 5(c)(iii) above (as applicable) shall prevail.

For the purposes of this paragraph 5(c), references to a rate being "permanently discontinued" shall be deemed to be references to such rate being permanently discontinued following a public statement or publication of information which would constitute an Index Cessation Event in respect of that rate in the relevant tenor.

(d) if the definition, methodology, formula or other means of calculating the Relevant Benchmark or the Applicable Fallback Rate (or, if applicable, the index, benchmark or other price source that is referred to in the Relevant Benchmark or the Applicable Fallback Rate) is modified, each party acknowledges that, unless otherwise specified or agreed, references to that Relevant Benchmark or the Applicable Fallback Rate (or the index, benchmark or other price source that is referred to in the Relevant Benchmark or the Applicable Fallback Rate) shall be to the Relevant Benchmark or the Applicable Fallback Rate (or the index, benchmark or other price source that is referred to in the Relevant Benchmark or the Applicable Fallback Rate) as modified. In the event of any inconsistency between this paragraph 5(d) and paragraphs 5(a) and 5(b) above (including any terms used in those paragraphs and defined below and including subparagraphs 5(c)(ii) and 5(c)(iii) above as they apply in priority to paragraph 5(b) above), paragraphs 5(a) and 5(b) above including subparagraphs 5(c)(ii) and 5(c)(iii) as they apply in priority to paragraph 5(b) above shall prevail.

If the Protocol Covered Document to which this paragraph 5 applies is a Protocol Covered Master Agreement, the Relevant Benchmark is defined in the Protocol Covered Master Agreement and that definition is referenced in a Confirmation that supplements, forms part of and is subject to that Protocol Covered Master Agreement, then the reference in the Protocol Covered Master Agreement to the Relevant Benchmark as amended by this paragraph 5 will also apply to the reference to the Relevant Benchmark in that Confirmation.
