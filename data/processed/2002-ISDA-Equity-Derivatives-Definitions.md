# **INTRODUCTION TO THE 2002 ISDA EQUITY DERIVATIVES DEFINITIONS**

The 2002 ISDA Equity Derivatives Definitions (the "2002 Definitions") are intended for use in confirmations of individual equity derivatives transactions ("Confirmations") governed by agreements such as the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement or 2002 ISDA Master Agreement (the "ISDA Master Agreements") published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ("ISDA"). Copies of the ISDA Master Agreements are available from the executive offices of ISDA and also from the ISDA web-site (www.isda.org). A sample form of letter agreement constituting a Confirmation can be obtained from ISDA's web-site.

The 2002 Definitions revise and expand the 1996 ISDA Equity Derivatives Definitions (the "1996 Definitions"). The 2002 Definitions extend the product range covered to include:

- forwards (which are the subject of a separate article, Article 4);
- barrier instruments; and
- Bermuda options.

The 2002 Definitions also rework key procedures, notably the consequences of Merger Events and the approach to disruptions of trading activity. More details on these and other changes are given below.

The 2002 Definitions are intended to provide a basic framework for documenting OTC equity derivative transactions. As with other product-specific definitions published by ISDA, however, parties using the 2002 Definitions to document privately negotiated equity derivatives transactions may adapt or supplement the standard provisions set out in these 2002 Definitions to reflect the specific economic terms agreed between the parties to the relevant Transaction.

These 2002 Definitions can be incorporated by reference into any Confirmation. Existing Confirmations that incorporate the 1996 Definitions (or their predecessor 1994 ISDA Equity Option Definitions) will not, without further action by the parties, be affected by the use of these 2002 Definitions for other Transactions.

These 2002 Definitions are intended to reflect a global market standard. It is recognized, however, that, in documenting a given Transaction, parties may see a need to address considerations specific to particular jurisdictions, and the 2002 Definitions reflect this fact too. For instance, the process of determining the effective date for a merger is not the same worldwide, and the role or potential role of the Calculation Agent is evident in a number of provisions as a result of such variations of local practice and the consequent need to accommodate various approaches within the 2002 Definitions.

Users of these 2002 Definitions should satisfy themselves that any particular term or provision suits their intention in a given Transaction, or they should amend the term or provision accordingly, which any party remains free to do.

# **New Features â An Overview**

A fundamental change from the 1996 Definitions relates to settlement provisions. These provisions were previously tied exclusively to options but, in the 2002 Definitions, have become generic, such that parties may choose to stipulate physical or cash settlement for any instrument, whether option, swap or forward. There is also a provision (denoted Settlement Method Election) designed to support instruments whose terms permit, at some point during the life of the instrument, a choice between physical and cash settlement by one of the parties.

Regarding the Consequences of Merger Events, parties have a broader range of alternatives to choose from. In particular, under the Cancellation and Payment alternative for option transactions, parties have a further choice, between more structured and more flexible approaches. The 2002 Definitions also have elective provisions that are designed to deal with tender offers and a number of other circumstances, notably disruptions to hedging and stock borrowing.

Since the publication of the 1996 Definitions, use of electronic mail has grown considerably, among other things in the transmission of Confirmations. ISDA considers that such communications may constitute a form of written communication and has indicated this in Section 12(a) of the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement. These 2002 Definitions do not specifically mention use of electronic mail at those junctures where written notice is referred to. Parties are, however, advised that the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement specifically envisages the use of electronic mail in day-to-day communications, though excluding it for the purposes of notices under Section 5 (Events of Default and Termination Events) and Section 6 (Early Termination).

At the same time, these 2002 Definitions explicitly include 'non-reliance' language (see Article 13). The ISDA Equity Derivatives Committee indicated that this language should be available in support of equity derivatives transactions. It is accordingly envisaged that parties may invoke this language in Confirmations where an election to this effect is included. Article 13 also includes elective disclaimer provisions relating to hedging activities and the use of indices.

â¢ **Specific Aspects of the 2002 Definitions.** Below are more details on specific aspects of the 2002 ISDA Equity Derivatives Definitions.

Examples of provisions for inclusion in Confirmations to document specific types of over-thecounter equity derivative transactions can be obtained from the ISDA web-site.

- **Forward Transactions.** As mentioned above, the range of products covered by the 2002 Definitions builds on that in the 1996 Definitions. Perhaps the most fundamental addition involves forwards, which were deliberately omitted in the 1996 Definitions. A significant factor in their inclusion has been the range of forward products now traded by some counterparties, including prepaid and variable-obligation products.
- **Barrier Transactions.** Barrier terms for equity derivatives transactions have grown in significance since the publication of the 1996 Definitions, and relevant terms have accordingly been included in the 2002 Definitions. Parties are advised to consider, among other things, the exact nature of the barrier Transaction concerned, and specifically whether the determination of a Knock-in Event or Knock-out Event is a function of the market at a particular time â as provided for in the 2002 Definitions â or of a 'one-touch' test involving the market price at any time on any Exchange Business Day that is also a Knock-in/Knock-out Determination Day. Barrier terms have been included in Article 1, so that they may be applied to any type of Transaction.
- **Basket Transactions.** After careful consideration, there has been minimal change to the treatment of basket products. Thus, there continues to be an ability to isolate those components of a basket affected by a disruption for delayed valuation, while continuing to value those components that one

can value. One additional provision is, however, worth noting: under Consequences of Merger Events (in Article 12.2), parties may now choose Partial Cancellation and Payment, which is a provision devised specifically for basket trades where only certain components of the basket may be directly affected by the event.

â¢ **Business Days.** The 2002 Definitions support a finer distinction as to what constitutes an Exchange Business Day (and any disruptions to it). Specifically, they introduce the concept of Scheduled Trading Day, and amend accordingly the definition of Exchange Business Day. In particular, the term 'Scheduled' is designed to offer a clear yet flexible standard, reflecting the possibility that exchanges' schedules may change from time to time, for a variety of reasons, without market participants necessarily wanting to treat such changes as market disruptions.

Separately, the term Currency Business Day has been updated to reflect the existence of the TARGET calendar associated with the euro.

â¢ **Disruptions.** As indicated above, it is important in determining business days also to be able to determine what constitutes a disruption to such a day. The 2002 Definitions look to two main types of disruption in determining whether a Disrupted Day has occured: (a) failure to open or (b) Market Disruption Event. The latter is in turn a function of three possible occurrences: (1) Trading Disruption; (2) Exchange Disruption; or (3) early closing, though this last type of event is subject to a significant qualification as described further below.

Of the three types of Market Disruption Event, Trading Disruption refers to a suspension or limitation of trading in shares (or, where relevant, a certain proportion of the shares in an index) or in related listed derivatives. This includes suspension or limitation by reason of movements in price exceeding limits permitted by the relevant Exchange or Related Exchange.

Exchange Disruption refers to a more general category of event that affects the exchange with the consequence of affecting the shares or related listed derivatives, rather than specifically relating to them.

Early closing is captured as a third form of Market Disruption Event, but does not apply if the closing is announced at least one hour before the closing in question or, if earlier, one hour before the submission deadline for orders to be entered for execution at the Valuation Time on that Exchange Business Day.

- **Consequences of Disruptions.** If there is a disruption which means that the prescribed valuation procedure cannot be followed, valuation may be delayed for up to eight Scheduled Trading Days after the originally scheduled Valuation Date. At the end of such period, the 2002 Definitions envisage that the Calculation Agent will determine the relevant valuation. The details of this contingency procedure are covered in Articles 6.6 â Consequences of Disrupted Days and 6.7, the latter dealing with disruptions to Averaging Dates. Similarly, there is a provision to delay an Expiration Date by up to eight Scheduled Trading Days after the originally scheduled Valuation Date. Exercise by notice, it should be noted, will still be binding, even if made on a Disrupted Day.
- **Merger Events.** A major objective in developing the 2002 Definitions was to ensure that the Consequences of Merger Events were updated to reflect the broad and diverse needs of parties in a variety of situations. This work involved a range of alterations to the 1996 Definitions. For example,

one refinement has been to include Partial Cancellation and Payment, as described above. The 2002 Definitions also allow the application of relevant consequence provisions in the event of a Tender Offer (defined as an offer for more than 10% but fewer than 100% of the outstanding voting shares) affecting a share, as well as other events, including 'reverse' mergers.

Some Merger Event provisions will be familiar to users of the 1996 Definitions, including Alternative Obligation and Options Exchange Adjustment. There have, however, been fundamental changes to the way certain provisions operate. In particular, the mechanisms underlying Cancellation and Payment (including the new Partial Cancellation and Payment) have been reworked, with two alternatives available for option transactions. One alternative, Calculation Agent Determination, affords a significant degree of flexibility in relation to the determination of the amount payable in respect of a Cancellation and Payment. In the other, an Agreed Model sets out in considerable detail how the value of the Transaction upon cancellation should be determined, taking into account changes in the level of Implied Volatility and other specified factors relevant to the price of an option. These changes are determined at specified points in relation to the occurrence of the Merger Event.

This choice, between Agreed Model and Calculation Agent Determination for option transactions, is one to which users of these 2002 Definitions should consider carefully when selecting Cancellation and Payment or Partial Cancellation and Payment.

A further change concerns the addition of Calculation Agent Adjustment as a possible consequence specified for a Merger Event. Moreover, another new consequence has been introduced: Modified Calculation Agent Adjustment. The main difference between the two consequences is that, under Modified Calculation Agent Adjustment, the Calculation Agent may adjust the Transaction to account for changes in volatility, expected dividends, stock loan rate or liquidity relevant to the Shares but is prohibited from doing so under Calculation Agent Adjustment. Both elections allow the Calculation Agent to proceed to Cancellation and Payment (in which case the Calculation Agent Determination method will apply to option transactions and a Cancellation Amount will be determined by the Determining Party or Parties for forward and swap transactions) in the event that, in its view, no adjustment it could make to the Transaction would produce a commercially reasonable result.

Another alteration is that, with regards to a Share-for-Combined Merger Event, parties may specify "Component Adjustment", whereby they distinguish in terms of consequence between (a) that portion of the consideration that consists of New Shares and (b) the portion of the consideration that consists of Other Consideration. Under this provision, the consequence selected by the parties for a Share-for-Share Merger Event will apply to the former and that selected for a Share-for-Other Merger Event will apply to the latter.

Finally, with regards to Merger Events, users may wish to note that there is a certain amount of flexibility built into the determination of Merger Date. While specific standards apply in many jurisdictions, the evidence suggested that this was not consistent across jurisdictions and, in some instances, within them. A standard is therefore offered, but the need for flexibility is explicitly recognized too.

â¢ **Additional Events.** Alongside Merger Events, the 2002 Definitions introduce a series of Additional Disruption Events, namely: "Change in Law", "Failure to Deliver", "Insolvency Filing", "Hedging Disruption", "Increased Cost of Hedging", "Loss of Stock Borrow" and "Increased Cost of Stock Borrow". Any of these events can be elected to apply to a Transaction, and may trigger termination of the Transaction.

The 1996 Definitions included Nationalization and Insolvency as events that could lead to either Negotiated Close-out or Cancellation and Payment. Not only has Partial Cancellation and Payment been introduced in the 2002 Definitions as a possible consequence, consistent with the treatment of Merger Events (including Tender Offers), but a further event has been identified, namely Delisting.

- **Potential Adjustment Events.** Potential Adjustment Events now expressly specify the triggering of any shareholder rights plan or arrangement directed against hostile takeovers and involving the distribution of securities at a below-market price â an arrangement sometimes referred to as a 'poison pill'.
- **Dividends.** Consideration was given to the question of more detailed provisions in relation to Dividends. In the end, due to the jurisdiction and Transaction-specific nature of Dividend issues, the revision was limited in scope. In particular, because of the difficulties of determining in advance in any formulaic way what would constitute an Extraordinary Dividend, the details of this are left to parties to state in their Confirmations. The 2002 Definitions do, however, provide for the selection of record date, ex-dividend date or payment date as relevant to determining the Dividend Amount.

If Re-investment of Dividends is selected by the parties to be applicable in an Equity Swap Transaction, the parties should note that Dividends shall not be deemed re-invested until the next Cash Settlement Payment Date. This approach removes for the purposes of the Transaction any economic exposure to that variable â and to interest rates â for the amount of the Dividend, for the time between payment of the Dividend and the next Cash Settlement Payment Date.

- **Settlement.** The settlement provisions have also been amended. While the pattern of market activity may suggest that certain types of Transaction are more likely to be subject to a particular form of settlement, members agreed that there was sufficient benefit to making these provisions fully modular, in the interests of maximum flexibility. A further level of flexibility is supported in Settlement Method Election, designed for instruments where a party may, during the life of the instrument, choose between Physical and Cash Settlement. Here though, certain default provisions are included (except for Option Transactions), reflecting the typical market-activity patterns alluded to above.
- **The Euro.** As mentioned above (in relation to the term Currency Business Day), the 2002 Definitions reflect the existence of the TARGET holiday calendar for business in the euro. In addition, Article 11 ensures that the Calculation Agent can take account of changes in the currency of quotation of shares underlying an equity derivative transaction from a 'legacy' currency to the euro.
- **Calculation Agent.** A certain amount of flexibility has been built into a number of the provisions in these 2002 Definitions, entailing the involvement of the Calculation Agent in relation to a given Transaction. Users of the 2002 Definitions are advised that the conduct of the Calculation Agent is subject to a general standard of acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, as set out in Section 1.40. Section 1.40 also states that the Calculation Agent is not acting as a fiduciary or advisor to any party to a Transaction.

â¢ **Incorporation of the 2002 Definitions.** The 2002 Definitions are intended wherever possible to operate on a free-standing basis and therefore, for most equity derivative transactions, there is no need to incorporate any other ISDA definitions booklets into the Confirmation of an equity derivative transaction. For Equity Swap Transactions, however, parties may wish to incorporate the 2000 ISDA Definitions if one leg of the Transaction involves payments of Floating Amounts linked to interest rates or currency exchange rates.

# **Conclusion**

ISDA has provided these 2002 Definitions to assist the smooth and efficient functioning of the equity derivatives market by providing a common set of terms for parties to use in preparing Confirmations for privately negotiated equity derivative transactions. *However, the precise documentation of each individual Transaction remains the responsibility of the parties concerned. ISDA assumes no responsibility for any use to which these 2002 Definitions may be put, including, without limitation, any use of these 2002 Definitions in connection with any privately negotiated equity derivative transaction. Each party to a Transaction evidenced by a Confirmation referring to or incorporating these 2002 Definitions must satisfy itself that the 2002 Definitions are appropriate for the Transaction, have been properly used and/or adapted in the Confirmation for the Transaction and that the Confirmation has generally been properly drafted, in each case, to reflect the commercial intentions of the parties. It should be noted that Confirmations that incorporate the 1996 ISDA Equity Derivatives Definitions shall continue to be governed by the 1996 ISDA Equity Derivatives Definitions. By using these 2002 Definitions to document an equity derivative transaction, no inference shall be made as to the meaning of any provision in the 1996 ISDA Equity Derivatives Definitions.* 

This Introduction is not part of the 2002 Definitions and is not offered as an interpretation of the 2002 Definitions.

If such day is a Disrupted Day due to the occurrence of such an event, then the Knock-in Determination Day shall be the first succeeding Scheduled Trading Day that is not a Disrupted Day, unless each of the eight Scheduled Trading Days immediately following the original date that, but for the occurrence of a Disrupted Day, would have been the Knock-in Determination Day is a Disrupted Day. In that case, that eighth Scheduled Trading Day shall be deemed to be the Knock-in Determination Day, notwithstanding the fact that such day is a Disrupted Day, and the Calculation Agent shall determine the level, price or amount of the Knock-in Reference Security in the same manner that it would determine a level, price or amount of an Index, Share or Basket on a deemed Valuation Date that is also a Disrupted Day in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.6(a)(ii), (b) or (c), as the case may be. In the event that the related Confirmation does not specify any Knock-in Determination Days, each Scheduled Trading Day from and including the Trade Date to and including the final Valuation Date, the Expiration Date or, if there is no such Valuation Date or Expiration Date, the date that is one Settlement Cycle prior to the final Settlement Date in relation to the Transaction (adjusted, if applicable, as provided in Sections 3.1(f) and 6.6) shall be deemed to be Knock-in Determination Days in relation to the Transaction.

If such day is a Disrupted Day due to the occurrence of such an event, then the Knock-out Determination Day shall be the first succeeding Scheduled Trading Day that is not a Disrupted Day, unless each of the eight Scheduled Trading Days immediately following the original date that, but for the occurrence of a Disrupted Day, would have been the Knock-out Determination Day is a Disrupted Day. In that case, that eighth Scheduled Trading Day shall be deemed to be the Knock-out Determination Day, notwithstanding the fact that such day is a Disrupted Day, and the Calculation Agent shall determine the level, price or amount of the Knock-out Reference Security in the same manner that it would determine a level, price or amount of an Index, Share or Basket on a deemed Valuation Date that is a Disrupted Day in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.6(a)(ii), (b) or (c), as the case may be. In the event that the related Confirmation does not specify any Knock-out Determination Days, each Scheduled Trading Day from and including the Trade Date to and including the final Valuation Date, the Expiration Date or, if there is no such Valuation Date or Expiration Date, the date that is one Settlement Cycle prior to the final Settlement Date in relation to the Transaction (adjusted, if applicable, as provided in Sections 3.1(f) and 6.6) shall be deemed to be Knock-out Determination Days in relation to the Transaction.

If the relevant exchange closes prior to its Scheduled Closing Time and the specified Knock-in Valuation Time is after the actual closing time for its regular trading session, then the Knock-in Valuation Time shall be such actual closing time.

**Section 1.51. Knock-out Valuation Time.** "Knock-out Valuation Time" means, in respect of a Transaction that provides for a right to receive, or obligation to make, a payment or delivery that is subject to a Knock-out Event, the time on any Knock-out Determination Day specified as such in the related Confirmation. In the event that the related Confirmation does not specify a Knock-out Valuation Time, the Knock-out Valuation Time shall be the Valuation Time specified in the related Confirmation, or if no Valuation Time is specified, the Scheduled Closing Time on the relevant exchange for the Knock-out Reference Security on any Knock-out Determination Day, in relation to the index, share, other security or basket to be valued. If the relevant exchange closes prior to its Scheduled Closing Time and the specified Knock-out Valuation Time is after the actual closing time for its regular trading session, then the Knock-out Valuation Time shall be such actual closing time.

(b) **Exercise Date.** "Exercise Date" means, in respect of an Option Transaction, the Scheduled Trading Day during the Exercise Period on which such Option is, or is deemed to be, exercised.

(c) **Potential Exercise Date.** "Potential Exercise Date" means, in respect of a Bermuda Option, each date specified as such in the related Confirmation (or, if such date is not a Scheduled Trading Day, the next following Scheduled Trading Day), unless such date is a Disrupted Day due to the occurrence of an event giving rise to a Disrupted Day prior to the Latest Exercise Time on such date. If such date is a Disrupted Day due to the occurrence of such an event, then the Potential Exercise Date shall be the first succeeding Scheduled Trading Day that is not a Disrupted Day, unless each of the eight Scheduled Trading Days immediately following the original date that, but for the occurrence of a Disrupted Day, would have been the Potential Exercise Date is a Disrupted Day. In that case, that eighth Scheduled Trading Day shall be deemed to be the Potential Exercise Date, notwithstanding the fact that such day is a Disrupted Day. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Option Transaction is exercised on a Scheduled Trading Day that would have been a Potential Exercise Date prior to the occurrence of an event giving rise to a Disrupted Day, such Scheduled Trading Day shall be deemed to be the Potential Exercise Date for the purpose of determining whether an Exercise Date has occurred during the Exercise Period.

Except as set forth below, any attempt to exercise on any such Scheduled Trading Day:

(i) more than the Maximum Number of Options will be deemed to be an exercise of the Maximum Number of Options (the number of Options exceeding the Maximum Number of Options being deemed to remain unexercised);

(ii) less than the Minimum Number of Options will be ineffective; and

(iii) an amount of Options not equal to or an integral multiple of the Integral Multiple will be deemed to be an exercise of a number of Options equal to the next lowest integral multiple of the Integral Multiple (the number of Options exceeding that number being deemed to remain unexercised).

 (c) "In-the-Money" means (i) in respect of a Call, that (A) the Reference Price is equal to or greater than the price for a Share at which any Related Exchange would automatically exercise a Physically-settled option with the Strike Price relating to such Share, or (B) if no options relating to such Share are listed on any Related Exchange or no Related Exchange is specified in the related Confirmation, the Reference Price is greater than the Strike Price; and (ii) in respect of a Put, that (A) the Reference Price is equal to or less than the price for a Share at which any Related Exchange would automatically exercise a Physically-settled option with the Strike Price relating to such Share, or (B) if no options relating to such Share are listed on any Related Exchange or no Related Exchange is specified in the related Confirmation, the Reference Price is less than the Strike Price.

(d) "Reference Price" means the price per Share or amount per Basket determined as provided in the related Confirmation as of the Expiration Time on the Expiration Date or, if no means of determining such price or amount are so provided, in respect of a Share Option Transaction, the Relevant Price of the Share (for which purpose the Valuation Time and the Valuation Date will be the Expiration Time and the Expiration Date, respectively) and, in respect of a Share Basket Option Transaction, the sum of the values calculated as of the Expiration Time on the Expiration Date for the Shares of each Issuer as the product of the Relevant Price of such Share (for which purpose the Valuation Time and the Valuation Date will be the Expiration Time and the Expiration Date, respectively) and the relevant Number of Shares comprised in the Basket.

In that case, (i) that eighth Scheduled Trading Day shall be deemed to be the Valuation Date for the relevant Index, notwithstanding the fact that such day is a Disrupted Day, and (ii) the Calculation Agent shall determine the level of that Index as of the Valuation Time on that eighth Scheduled Trading Day in accordance with the formula for and method of calculating that Index last in effect prior to the occurrence of the first Disrupted Day using the Exchange traded or quoted price as of the Valuation Time on that eighth Scheduled Trading Day of each security comprised in that Index (or, if an event giving rise to a Disrupted Day has occurred in respect of the relevant security on that eighth Scheduled Trading Day, its good faith estimate of the value for the relevant security as of the Valuation Time on that eighth Scheduled Trading Day); and

(c) in the case of a Share Basket Transaction, the Valuation Date for each Share not affected by the occurrence of a Disrupted Day shall be the Scheduled Valuation Date, and the Valuation Date for each Share affected by the occurrence of a Disrupted Day shall be the first succeeding Scheduled Trading Day that is not a Disrupted Day relating to that Share, unless each of the eight Scheduled Trading Days immediately following the Scheduled Valuation Date is a Disrupted Day relating to that Share. In that case, (i) that eighth Scheduled Trading Day shall be deemed to be the Valuation Date for the relevant Share, notwithstanding the fact that such day is a Disrupted Day, and (ii) the Calculation Agent shall determine its good faith estimate of the value for that Share as of the Valuation Time on that eighth Scheduled Trading Day.

**Section 6.7. Averaging.** If Averaging Dates are specified in the related Confirmation, then notwithstanding any other provisions of these Definitions, the following provisions will apply to the valuation of the relevant Index, Share or Basket in respect of a Valuation Date:

(b) **Settlement Price and Final Price.** For purposes of determining the Settlement Price or the Final Price, as the case may be, in respect of a Valuation Date, the Settlement Price or the Final Price will be:

 (i) in respect of an Index Transaction or Cash-settled Share Transaction, the arithmetic mean of the Relevant Prices of the Index or the Shares on each Averaging Date;

(ii) in respect of an Index Basket Transaction, the arithmetic mean of the amounts for the Basket determined by the Calculation Agent as provided in the related Confirmation as of the relevant Valuation Time(s) on each Averaging Date or, if no means for determining the Settlement Price or the Final Price are so provided, the arithmetic mean of the amounts for the Basket calculated on each Averaging Date as the sum of the Relevant Prices of each Index comprised in the Basket (weighted or adjusted in relation to each Index as provided in the related Confirmation); and

 (iii) in respect of a Cash-settled Share Basket Transaction, the arithmetic mean of the amounts for the Basket determined by the Calculation Agent as provided in the related Confirmation as of the relevant Valuation Time(s) on each Averaging Date or, if no means for determining the Settlement Price or the Final Price are so provided, the arithmetic mean of the amounts for the Basket calculated on each Averaging Date as the sum of the values calculated for the Shares of each Issuer as the product of (A) the Relevant Price of such Share and (B) the relevant Number of Shares comprised in the Basket.

(c) **Averaging Date Disruption.** If any Averaging Date is a Disrupted Day, then, if under "Averaging Date Disruption" the consequence specified in the related Confirmation is:

(i) "Omission", then such Averaging Date will be deemed not to be a relevant Averaging Date for purposes of determining the relevant Settlement Price or Final Price. If through the operation of this provision no Averaging Date would occur with respect to the relevant Valuation Date, then Section 6.6 will apply for purposes of determining the relevant level, price or amount on the final Averaging Date in respect of that Valuation Date as if such final Averaging Date were a Valuation Date that was a Disrupted Day;

(ii) "Postponement", then Section 6.6 will apply for purposes of determining the relevant level, price or amount on that Averaging Date as if such Averaging Date were a Valuation Date that was a Disrupted Day irrespective of whether, pursuant to such determination, that deferred Averaging Date would fall on a date that already is or is deemed to be an Averaging Date for the Transaction; or

(iii) "Modified Postponement", then:

 (A) in the case of an Index Transaction or a Share Transaction, the Averaging Date shall be the first succeeding Valid Date. If the first succeeding Valid Date has not occurred as of the Valuation Time on the eighth Scheduled Trading Day immediately following the original date that, but for the occurrence of another Averaging Date or Disrupted Day, would have been the final Averaging Date in respect of the relevant Scheduled Valuation Date, then (1) that eighth Scheduled Trading Day shall be deemed the Averaging Date (irrespective of whether that eighth Scheduled Trading Day is already an Averaging Date), and (2) the Calculation Agent shall determine the relevant level or price for that Averaging Date in accordance with Section 6.6;

 (B) in the case of an Index Basket Transaction or a Share Basket Transaction, the Averaging Date for each Index or Share not affected by the occurrence of a Disrupted Day shall be the date specified in the Confirmation as an Averaging Date in respect of the relevant Valuation Date and the Averaging Date for an Index or Share affected by the occurrence of a Disrupted Day shall be the first succeeding Valid Date in relation to such Index or Share. If the first succeeding Valid Date in respect of such Index or Share has not occurred as of the Valuation Time on the eighth Scheduled Trading Day immediately following the original date that, but for the occurrence of another Averaging Date or Disrupted Day, would have been the final Averaging Date in relation to the relevant Scheduled Valuation Date, then (1) that eighth Scheduled Trading Day shall be deemed to be the Averaging Date (irrespective of whether that eighth Scheduled Trading Day is already an Averaging Date) in respect of such Index or Share, and (2) the Calculation Agent shall determine the relevant level, price or amount for that Averaging Date in accordance with Section 6.6; and

(C) "Valid Date" shall mean a Scheduled Trading Day that is not a Disrupted Day and on which another Averaging Date in respect of the relevant Valuation Date does not or is not deemed to occur.

(d) If any Averaging Dates in relation to a Valuation Date occur after that Valuation Date as a result of the occurrence of a Disrupted Day, then (i) the relevant Cash Settlement Payment Date or Settlement Date, as the case may be, or (ii) the occurrence of an Extraordinary Event or a Potential Adjustment Event shall be determined by reference to the last such Averaging Date as though it were that Valuation Date.

(e) **Adjustments to Indices.** If (i) on or prior to any Averaging Date in respect of an Index Transaction or Index Basket Transaction an Index Modification or Index Cancellation occurs, or (ii) on any Averaging Date in respect of an Index Transaction or Index Basket Transaction an Index Disruption occurs, then the consequence specified in respect of Index Adjustment Events for the purpose of Section 11.1(b) shall apply to such Index Transaction or Index Basket Transaction.

**Section 6.8. Futures Price Valuation.** If "Futures Price Valuation" is specified as applicable in respect of an Index in the related Confirmation of an Index Transaction, then notwithstanding any other provisions of these Definitions the following provisions will apply to the valuation of that Index on a Valuation Date:

(a) **Valuation Date.** For the purpose of this Section 6.8 only, "Valuation Date" shall mean a day on which the Official Settlement Price is published and, in all cases except for Section 6.8(e), irrespective of whether such day is a Disrupted Day.

# (b) **Additional Definitions Relating to Futures Price Valuation.**

(i) "Exchange-traded Contract" in relation to an Index means a contract specified as such for that Index in the related Confirmation. For this purpose, the parties shall specify the futures or options contract by reference to (A) the Index to which it relates, (B) the delivery month of such contract and (C) the exchange on which it is traded.

(ii) "Official Settlement Price" means the official settlement price (however described under the rules of the relevant Exchange or its clearing house) of any of the relevant Exchange-traded Contracts published by the Exchange or its clearing house.

(c) **Settlement Price and Final Price.** For purposes of determining the Settlement Price or the Final Price, as the case may be, on a Valuation Date:

 (i) in respect of an Index Transaction, the Settlement Price or the Final Price will be the Official Settlement Price on that Valuation Date; and

 (ii) in respect of an Index Basket Transaction, the Settlement Price or the Final Price will be determined as otherwise provided in these Definitions, provided, however, that in relation to each Index for which Futures Price Valuation is applicable, the Relevant Price will be the Official Settlement Price (weighted or adjusted in relation to that Index as provided in the related Confirmation) on that Valuation Date.

(d) **Adjustments of the Exchange-traded Contract.** Without duplication of Section 11.1 (which shall govern in the event of any conflict), in the event that the terms of the Exchange-traded Contract are changed or modified by the Exchange, the Calculation Agent shall, if necessary, adjust one or more of the Strike Price, the Number of Options, the Initial Price, the Forward Price, the Forward Floor Price, the Forward Cap Price, the Knock-in Price, the Knock-out Price and/or any other variable relevant to the settlement terms of the Transaction to preserve for each party the economic equivalent of any payment or payments (assuming satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) by the parties in respect of the Transaction that would have been required after the date of such change.

 (e) **Non-Commencement or Discontinuance of the Exchange-traded Contract.** If there is no Official Settlement Price as a result of the fact that trading in the Exchange-traded Contract never commences or is permanently discontinued at any time on or prior to a Valuation Date, the Official Settlement Price for that Valuation Date shall be deemed to be the level of the relevant Index at the close of the regular trading session on the relevant Exchange on the Valuation Date. If this Section 6.8(e) applies, then the Expiration Date, in respect of an Option Transaction, or the relevant Valuation Date, in respect of a Forward Transaction or an Equity Swap Transaction, shall mean the date that, but for the non-commencement or permanent discontinuance of the Exchange-traded Contract, would have been the date of publishing the relevant Official Settlement Price unless such day is a Disrupted Day, in which case the provisions of Sections 3.1(f) or 6.6, as applicable, will apply.

 (f) **Corrections of the Official Settlement Price.** If the Official Settlement Price for any Valuation Date is corrected and the correction is published by the relevant exchange within one Settlement Cycle for the related Exchange-traded Contract after the original publication, either party may notify the other party of that correction and the Calculation Agent will determine the amount that is payable as a result of that correction and, to the extent necessary, will adjust the terms of such Transaction to account for such correction.

If a Settlement Disruption Event does prevent delivery on that date, then the Settlement Date will be the first succeeding date on which delivery of the Shares can take place through the relevant Clearance System unless a Settlement Disruption Event prevents settlement on each of the eight relevant Clearance System Business Days immediately following the original date that, but for the Settlement Disruption Event, would have been the Settlement Date. In that case, (x) if such Shares can be delivered in any other commercially reasonable manner, then the Settlement Date will be the first date on which settlement of a sale of Shares executed on that eighth relevant Clearance System Business Day customarily would take place using such other commercially reasonable manner of delivery (which other manner of delivery will be deemed the relevant Clearance System for the purposes of delivery of the relevant Shares), and (y) if such Shares cannot be delivered in any other commercially reasonable manner, then the Settlement Date will be postponed until delivery can be effected through the relevant Clearance System or in any other commercially reasonable manner.

x Number of Baskets Settlement Price Forward Floor Price + (Settlement Price - Forward Cap Price)

and

(d) under a Share Basket Swap Transaction, the Number of Baskets.

In respect of an Issuer comprising the Basket, if the aggregate number of Shares of such Issuer calculated by multiplying the relevant Number of Shares by the Number of Baskets to be Delivered comprises a fractional Share, then the aggregate number of Shares of such Issuer that is delivered will include only whole Shares and a Fractional Share Amount will be payable by the relevant party in lieu of such fractional Share.

**Section 9.7. Fractional Share Amount.** "Fractional Share Amount" means an amount in the Settlement Currency representing the fractional Share resulting from the calculation of the Number of Shares to be Delivered or the Number of Baskets to be Delivered in respect of a Transaction as determined by the Calculation Agent multiplied by:

**Section 9.11. Representation and Agreement.** A party required to deliver Shares under a Transaction agrees that it will convey, and, on any date that it delivers such Shares, represents that it has conveyed, good title to the Shares it is required to deliver, free from (i) any lien, charge, claim or other encumbrance (other than a lien routinely imposed on all securities by the relevant Clearance System) and any other restrictions whatsoever, including any restrictions under applicable securities laws, without any obligation on the part of the receiver of such Shares in connection with that party's subsequent sale of such Shares to deliver an offering document, or comply with any volume or manner of sale restrictions, (ii) any and all restrictions that any sale, assignment or other transfer of such Shares be consented to or approved by any person or entity, including without limitation, the Issuer or any other obligor thereon, (iii) any limitations on the type or status, financial or otherwise, of any purchaser, pledgee, assignee or transferee of such Shares, (iv) any requirement of the delivery of any certificate, approval, consent, agreement, opinion of counsel, notice or any other document of any person or entity to the Issuer of, any other obligor on or any registrar or transfer agent for, such Shares, prior to the sale, pledge, assignment or other transfer of such Shares, and (v) any registration or qualification requirement or prospectus delivery requirement for such Shares pursuant to applicable securities laws. A party required to deliver Shares under a Transaction also represents that to the extent appropriate for the relevant Clearance System, the Shares are properly in book-entry form.

Indemnification for Failure to Deliver.** If, in respect of any obligation to deliver Shares under a Transaction, prior to the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of that Transaction, a party fails to perform any obligation required to be settled by delivery, it will indemnify the other party on demand for any costs, losses or expenses (including the costs of borrowing the relevant Shares, if applicable) resulting from such failure. A certificate signed by the deliveree setting out such costs, losses or expenses in reasonable detail will be conclusive evidence that they have been incurred. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless the parties otherwise agree to the contrary expressly and in writing in the related Confirmation, a party shall not be responsible for any special, indirect or consequential damages, even if informed of the possibility thereof.

(b) If (i) on or prior to any Valuation Date in respect of an Index Transaction or Index Basket Transaction, a relevant Index Sponsor announces that it will make a material change in the formula for or the method of calculating that Index or in any other way materially modifies that Index (other than a modification prescribed in that formula or method to maintain that Index in the event of changes in constituent stock and capitalization and other routine events) (an "Index Modification") or permanently cancels the Index and no Successor Index exists (an "Index Cancellation") or (ii) on any Valuation Date in respect of an Index Transaction or Index Basket Transaction, the Index Sponsor fails to calculate and announce a relevant Index (an "Index Disruption" and together with an Index Modification and an Index Cancellation, each an "Index Adjustment Event"), then:

(A) if "Calculation Agent Adjustment" is specified in the related Confirmation as the consequence of any such Index Adjustment Event, then the Calculation Agent shall determine if such Index Adjustment Event has a material effect on the Index Transaction and, if so, shall calculate the relevant Settlement Price, Final Price, Strike Price, Forward Price, Forward Floor Price, Forward Cap Price, Knock-in Price or Knock-out Price, as the case may be, using, in lieu of a published level for that Index, the level for that Index as at that Valuation Date as determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with the formula for and method of calculating that Index last in effect prior to the change, failure or cancellation, but using only those securities that comprised that Index immediately prior to that Index Adjustment Event;

(B) if "Negotiated Close-out" is specified in the related Confirmation as the consequence of any such Index Adjustment Event, then the parties may, but are not obliged to, terminate the Transaction on mutually acceptable terms and if they do not agree to terminate the Transaction, then it continues on the terms and subject to the conditions, formulas and calculation methods in effect as of any relevant time at which calculations may be made; or

(C) if "Cancellation and Payment" is specified in the related Confirmation as the consequence of any such Index Adjustment Event, then (1) in the case of an Index Disruption, the Transaction will be cancelled on the Valuation Date, (2) in the case of an Index Cancellation, the Transaction will be cancelled on the later of the Exchange Business Day immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Index Cancellation and the date the Index Cancellation is announced by the Index Sponsor, and (3) in the case of an Index Modification, either party may elect, upon two Scheduled Trading Days' notice or such lesser notice as may be required so that termination occurs not later than the effective date of the Index Modification, to cancel the Transaction at any time following the announcement of the Index Modification but no later than the Scheduled Trading Day prior to the effectiveness of such Index Modification and (X) in the case of an Index Option Transaction or an Index Basket Option Transaction, Seller will pay to Buyer the amount specified in Section 12.7(b)(ii) and (Y) in the case of an Index Swap Transaction, an Index Basket Swap Transaction, an Index Forward Transaction or an Index Basket Forward Transaction, an amount calculated in accordance with Section 12.7(c) will be paid by one party to the other. Any Transaction cancelled as a result of an Index Adjustment Event will be valued using the formula or method to calculate the Index in effect immediately prior to such Index Adjustment Event.

# **Section 11.2. Adjustments to Share Transactions and Share Basket Transactions.**

(a) "Method of Adjustment" means a method for determining the appropriate adjustment to make to the terms of a Share Transaction or Share Basket Transaction upon the occurrence of an event having, in the determination of the Calculation Agent, a diluting or concentrative effect on the theoretical value of the relevant Shares.

(b) If "Options Exchange Adjustment" is specified as the Method of Adjustment in the related Confirmation of a Share Transaction or Share Basket Transaction, then following each adjustment to the exercise, settlement, payment or other terms of options on any relevant Shares traded on any Options Exchange, the Calculation Agent will make the corresponding adjustments, if any, to any one or more of:

(i) in respect of a Share Option Transaction or a Share Basket Option Transaction, the Strike Price, the Number of Options, the Option Entitlement, the Knock-in Price, the Knockout Price, and the relevant Number of Shares;

(ii) in respect of a Share Forward Transaction or a Share Basket Forward Transaction, the Forward Price, the Forward Floor Price, the Forward Cap Price, the Knock-in Price, the Knock-out Price, and the relevant Number of Shares;

(iii) in respect of a Share Swap Transaction or a Share Basket Swap Transaction, the Initial Price, the Equity Notional Amount, the Knock-in Price, the Knock-out Price, and the relevant Number of Shares;

and, in any case, any other variable relevant to the exercise, settlement, payment or other terms of that Transaction, as determined by the Calculation Agent, which adjustment will be effective as of the date determined by the Calculation Agent to be the effective date of the corresponding adjustment made by the Options Exchange. If options on the relevant Shares are not traded on the Options Exchange, the Calculation Agent will make such adjustment, if any, to any one or more of the relevant variables referred to above or any other variable relevant to the exercise, settlement, payment or other terms of the Transaction as the Calculation Agent determines appropriate, with reference to the rules of and precedents (if any) set by the Options Exchange, to account for the diluting or concentrative effect of any event that, in the determination of the Calculation Agent, would have given rise to an adjustment by the Options Exchange if such options were so traded.

 (c) If "Calculation Agent Adjustment" is specified as the Method of Adjustment in the related Confirmation of a Share Transaction or Share Basket Transaction (or if no Method of Adjustment is specified in the related Confirmation for such Transaction), then following the declaration by the Issuer of the terms of any Potential Adjustment Event, the Calculation Agent will determine whether such Potential Adjustment Event has a diluting or concentrative effect on the theoretical value of the relevant Shares and, if so, will (i) make the corresponding adjustment(s), if any, to any one or more of:

(A) in respect of a Share Option Transaction or a Share Basket Option Transaction, the Strike Price, the Number of Options, the Option Entitlement, the Knock-in Price, the Knockout Price, and the relevant Number of Shares;

(B) in respect of a Share Forward Transaction or a Share Basket Forward Transaction, the Forward Price, the Forward Floor Price, the Forward Cap Price, the Knock-in Price, the Knock-out Price, and the relevant Number of Shares;

(C) in respect of a Share Swap Transaction or a Share Basket Swap Transaction, the Initial Price, the Equity Notional Amount, the Knock-in Price, the Knock-out Price, and the relevant Number of Shares;

and, in any case, any other variable relevant to the exercise, settlement, payment or other terms of that Transaction as the Calculation Agent determines appropriate to account for that diluting or concentrative effect (provided that no adjustments will be made to account solely for changes in volatility, expected dividends, stock loan rate or liquidity relative to the relevant Share) and (ii) determine the effective date(s) of the adjustment(s). The Calculation Agent may (but need not) determine the appropriate adjustment(s) by reference to the adjustment(s) in respect of such Potential Adjustment Event made by an options exchange to options on the relevant Shares traded on such options exchange.

(d) "Options Exchange" means the exchange or quotation system specified as such in the related Confirmation, any successor to such exchange or quotation system or any substitute exchange or quotation system to which trading in options contracts relating to the relevant Share has temporarily relocated (provided that the Calculation Agent has determined that there is comparable liquidity relative to such options contracts on such temporary substitute exchange or quotation system as on the original Options Exchange) or, if no such exchange or quotation system is specified in the related Confirmation, the Related Exchange (if such Related Exchange trades options contracts relating to the relevant Share) or, if more than one such Related Exchange is specified in the related Confirmation, the Related Exchange selected by the Calculation Agent as the primary market for listed options contracts relating to the relevant Share.

(e) "Potential Adjustment Event" means any of the following:

(i) a subdivision, consolidation or reclassification of relevant Shares (unless resulting in a Merger Event), or a free distribution or dividend of any such Shares to existing holders by way of bonus, capitalization or similar issue;

(ii) a distribution, issue or dividend to existing holders of the relevant Shares of (A) such Shares, or (B) other share capital or securities granting the right to payment of dividends and/or the proceeds of liquidation of the Issuer equally or proportionately with such payments to holders of such Shares, or (C) share capital or other securities of another issuer acquired or owned (directly or indirectly) by the Issuer as a result of a spin-off or other similar transaction, or (D) any other type of securities, rights or warrants or other assets, in any case for payment (cash or other consideration) at less than the prevailing market price as determined by the Calculation Agent;

- (iii) an Extraordinary Dividend;
- (iv) a call by the Issuer in respect of relevant Shares that are not fully paid;

(v) a repurchase by the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries of relevant Shares whether out of profits or capital and whether the consideration for such repurchase is cash, securities or otherwise;

(vi) in respect of the Issuer, an event that results in any shareholder rights being distributed or becoming separated from shares of common stock or other shares of the capital stock of the Issuer pursuant to a shareholder rights plan or arrangement directed against hostile takeovers that provides upon the occurrence of certain events for a distribution of preferred stock, warrants, debt instruments or stock rights at a price below their market value, as determined by the Calculation Agent, provided that any adjustment effected as a result of such an event shall be readjusted upon any redemption of such rights; or

(vii) any other event that may have a diluting or concentrative effect on the theoretical value of the relevant Shares.

**Section 11.3. Adjustments to Certain Share Transactions and Share Basket Transactions in European Currencies.** In respect of a Share Transaction or Share Basket Transaction relating to Shares originally quoted, listed and/or dealt as of the Trade Date in a currency of a member state of the European Union that has not adopted the single currency in accordance with the EC Treaty, if such Shares are at any time after the Trade Date quoted, listed and/or dealt exclusively in euro on the relevant Exchange or, where no Exchange is specified, the principal market on which those Shares are traded, then the Calculation Agent will adjust any one or more of the Strike Price, the Forward Price, the Forward Floor Price, the Forward Cap Price, the Knock-in Price, the Knock-out Price, the Settlement Price, the Initial Price, the Final Price and any other variable relevant to the terms of the Transaction as the Calculation Agent determines appropriate to preserve the economic terms of the Transaction. The Calculation Agent will make any conversion necessary for purposes of any such adjustment as of the Valuation Time at an appropriate mid-market spot rate of exchange determined by the Calculation Agent prevailing as of the Valuation Time. No adjustments under this Section 11.3 will affect the currency denomination of any payment obligation arising out of the Transaction.

**Section 11.4. Correction of Share Prices and Index Levels.** In the event that any price or level published on the Exchange or by the Index Sponsor and which is utilized for any calculation or determination made under a Transaction is subsequently corrected and the correction is published by the Exchange or the Index Sponsor within one Settlement Cycle after the original publication, either party may notify the other party of that correction and the Calculation Agent will determine the amount that is payable or deliverable as a result of that correction, and, to the extent necessary, will adjust the terms of such Transaction to account for such correction.

(b) Either party will, upon becoming aware of the occurrence of a Nationalization, Insolvency or Delisting, promptly notify the other party of such event.

(c) For the purpose of determining the consequence of any Nationalization, Insolvency or Delisting:

(i) "Negotiated Close-out" means that the parties may, but are not obliged, to terminate the Transaction on mutually acceptable terms and if the parties do not agree to terminate the Transaction, then it continues on the terms and subject to the conditions then in effect, provided, that any Physically-settled Transaction will, at the election of either party, become a Transaction to which Cash Settlement is applicable, except that if a Scheduled Valuation Date is a Disrupted Day, the Calculation Agent will ignore the provisions of Section 6.6 relating to Disrupted Days and will instead determine its good faith estimate of the Settlement Price or Final Price as of the Valuation Time on that Valuation Date;

(a) If, in respect of an Extraordinary Event, "Cancellation and Payment" or "Partial Cancellation and Payment" applies or is deemed to apply to the relevant Transaction (or a portion thereof), then an amount will be paid by one party to the other determined as provided in clause (b) or (c) below, such payment to be made not later than three Currency Business Days following the date that notice of the determination by the Calculation Agent or the Determining Party, as the case may be, of such amount (denominated in the currency for settlement of the Transaction as determined by the Calculation Agent or the Determining Party, as the case may be) and which party shall pay such amount is effective, which notice shall be provided promptly following such determination.

(b) In respect of an Option Transaction, the amount to be paid by Seller to Buyer will be as agreed promptly (and in any event within five Exchange Business Days) by the parties after the Merger Date, the Tender Offer Date, the date of cancellation in respect of an Index Adjustment Event or the date of occurrence of any event described in Section 12.6, as the case may be (each such date, the "Closing Date"). If the parties are unable to agree on the amount, then:

(i) if "Agreed Model" is specified in the related Confirmation to be applicable to such Transaction, then the amount will be determined by the Calculation Agent as the sum of the Unadjusted Value and the Adjustment Value. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer shall not be required to pay any amount to the Seller as a result of the cancellation of the Option Transaction other than any unpaid Premium which Buyer will be obliged to pay to Seller as of the date that the amount determined in this Section 12.7(b)(i) is paid.

(A) "Unadjusted Value" means an amount determined by the Calculation Agent as the value of the Option Transaction (or portion thereof) on the Closing Date based on:

(1) a volatility equal to the average of the Implied Volatilities of the relevant Shares on each of the 15 Exchange Business Days ending on and including the Closing Date;

(2) expected dividends for the time period from the Closing Date until the Expiration Date based on, and payable on the same dates as, (a) amounts to have been paid in respect of gross ordinary cash dividends on the relevant Shares in the one-year period ending on the Closing Date or (b) in the event of an Issuer published change to dividend policies on the relevant Shares (as determined by the Calculation Agent) prior to the Closing Date, the expected dividends determined in accordance with such published change, in each case excluding Extraordinary Dividends;

(3) a value ascribed to the relevant Shares as determined by the Calculation Agent and, if applicable, equal to the value of the consideration, if any, paid or delivered in respect of such Shares to holders of such Shares at the time of the Extraordinary Event;

(4) a combined interest rate and stock loan rate as specified in the related Confirmation for the period from, and including, the Closing Date to, but excluding, the Expiration Date; and

(5) a term of the Option Transaction from the Closing Date to the Expiration Date.

(B) "Adjustment Value" means the difference between the amounts determined pursuant to (B)(1) and (B)(2) below:

(1) a value of the Option Transaction (or portion thereof) determined by the Calculation Agent based on:

> (a) a volatility equal to the average of the Implied Volatilities of the relevant Shares on each of the 15 Exchange Business Days ending on but excluding the Announcement Date;

> (b) expected dividends for the time period from the Announcement Date until the Expiration Date based on, and payable on the same dates as, (x) amounts to have been paid in respect of gross ordinary cash dividends on the relevant Shares in the one-year period ending on the Announcement Date or (y) in the event of an Issuer published change to dividend policies on the relevant Shares (as determined by the Calculation Agent) prior to the Announcement Date, the expected dividends determined in accordance with such published change, in each case excluding Extraordinary Dividends;

> (c) a value ascribed to the relevant Shares equal to the Settlement Price (assuming Cash Settlement were applicable) of the relevant Shares as of the Valuation Time (for which purpose the Valuation Date will be the Announcement Date);

> (d) a combined interest rate and stock loan rate as specified in the related Confirmation for the period from, and including, the Announcement Date to, but excluding, the Expiration Date; and

> (e) a term of the Option Transaction from the Announcement Date to the Expiration Date.

(2) a value for the Option Transaction (or portion thereof) based on the factors listed in (1)(a)-(e) above, except with a volatility equal to the average of the Implied Volatilities of the relevant Shares on each of the 15 Exchange Business Days commencing on and including the Announcement Date.

(ii) If "Calculation Agent Determination" is specified in the related Confirmation to be applicable to such Transaction, then the amount will be determined by the Calculation Agent, which determination may, but need not, be based on the factors and adjustments set forth in paragraph (i) above.

(c) For any Forward Transaction or Equity Swap Transaction, such Transaction shall be cancelled and the relevant party or parties (as specified below) shall determine the Cancellation Amount in respect of such cancelled Transaction.

(i) In respect of a cancelled Transaction where there is one Determining Party, the Determining Party will calculate the Cancellation Amount and will determine which party will pay such amount.

(ii) In respect of a cancelled Transaction where there are two Determining Parties, each party will calculate a Cancellation Amount and an amount will be payable equal to one-half of the difference between the Cancellation Amount of the party with the higher Cancellation Amount ("X") and the Cancellation Amount of the party with the lower Cancellation Amount ("Y") and Y shall pay it to X.

# **Section 12.8. Cancellation Amount.**

(a) "Cancellation Amount" means, with respect to a Determining Party, the amount of the losses or costs of the Determining Party that are or would be incurred under then prevailing circumstances (expressed as a positive number) or gains of the Determining Party that are or would be realized under then prevailing circumstances (expressed as a negative number) in replacing, or in providing for the Determining Party the economic equivalent of, (i) the material terms of the relevant Transaction, including the payments and deliveries by the parties under the ISDA Master Agreement in respect of the relevant Transaction that would, but for the occurrence of the Extraordinary Event, have been required on or after the date that the Transaction is, or is deemed to have been, terminated or cancelled (assuming satisfaction of any applicable conditions precedent in the ISDA Master Agreement) and (ii) the option rights of the parties in respect of the relevant Transaction.

 (b) Any Cancellation Amount will be determined by the Determining Party (or its agent), which will act in good faith and use commercially reasonable procedures in order to produce a commercially reasonable result. Each Cancellation Amount will be determined as of the date that the Transaction terminated or cancelled or, if that would not be commercially reasonable, as of the date or dates following the date that the Transaction terminated or cancelled as would be commercially reasonable.

(c) In determining a Cancellation Amount, the Determining Party may consider any relevant information, including, without limitation, one or more of the following types of information:

(i) quotations (either firm or indicative) for replacement transactions supplied by one or more third parties that may take into account the current creditworthiness of the Determining Party at the time the quotation is provided and the terms of any relevant documentation, including credit support documentation, between the Determining Party and the third party providing the quotation;

(ii) information consisting of relevant market data in the relevant market supplied by one or more third parties including, without limitation, relevant rates, prices, yields, yield curves, volatilities, spreads, correlations or other relevant market data in the relevant market; or

(iii) information of the types described in (i) or (ii) above from internal sources (including any Affiliates of the Determining Party) if that information is of the same type used by the Determining Party in the regular course of its business for the valuation of similar transactions.

 (d) The Determining Party will consider, taking into account the standards and procedures described in this definition, quotations pursuant to Section 12.8(c)(i) above or relevant market data pursuant to Section 12.8(c)(ii) above unless the Determining Party reasonably believes in good faith that such quotations or relevant market data are not readily available or would produce a result that would not satisfy those standards. When considering information described in Section 12.8(c)(i), (c)(ii) or (c)(iii) above, the Determining Party may include costs of funding, to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other information being utilized. Third parties supplying quotations pursuant to Section 12.8(c)(i) above or market data pursuant to Section 12.8(c)(ii) above may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors, brokers and other sources of market information.

(e) Without duplication of amounts calculated based on information described in Section 12.8(c)(i), 12.8(c)(ii) or 12.8(c)(iii) above, or other relevant information, and when it is commercially reasonable to do so, the Determining Party may in addition consider in calculating a Cancellation Amount any loss or cost incurred in connection with its terminating, liquidating or re-establishing any hedge related to such Transaction (or any gain resulting from any of them).

(f) "Determining Party" means the party or parties specified as such in the related Confirmation.

(g) Commercially reasonable procedures used in determining a Cancellation Amount may include the following:

(i) application to relevant market data from third parties pursuant to Section 12.8(c)(ii) above or information from internal sources pursuant to Section 12.8(c)(iii) above of pricing or other valuation models that are, at the time of the determination of the Cancellation Amount, used by the Determining Party in the regular course of its business in pricing or valuing transactions between the Determining Party and unrelated third parties that are similar to the relevant Transaction; and

(ii) application of different valuation methods to the relevant Transaction depending on the type, complexity or size of the relevant Transaction.

(v) "Hedging Disruption" means that the Hedging Party is unable, after using commercially reasonable efforts, to (A) acquire, establish, re-establish, substitute, maintain, unwind or dispose of any transaction(s) or asset(s) it deems necessary to hedge the equity price risk of entering into and performing its obligations with respect to the relevant Transaction, or (B) realize, recover or remit the proceeds of any such transaction(s) or asset(s);

(vi) "Increased Cost of Hedging" means that the Hedging Party would incur a materially increased (as compared with circumstances existing on the Trade Date) amount of tax, duty, expense or fee (other than brokerage commissions) to (A) acquire, establish, re-establish, substitute, maintain, unwind or dispose of any transaction(s) or asset(s) it deems necessary to hedge the equity price risk of entering into and performing its obligations with respect to the relevant Transaction, or (B) realize, recover or remit the proceeds of any such transaction(s) or asset(s), provided that any such materially increased amount that is incurred solely due to the deterioration of the creditworthiness of the Hedging Party shall not be deemed an Increased Cost of Hedging;

 (vii) "Loss of Stock Borrow" means that the Hedging Party is unable, after using commercially reasonable efforts, to borrow (or maintain a borrowing of) Shares with respect to such Transaction in an amount equal to the Hedging Shares (not to exceed the number of Shares underlying the Transaction) at a rate equal to or less than the Maximum Stock Loan Rate;

 (viii) "Increased Cost of Stock Borrow" means that the Hedging Party would incur a rate to borrow Shares in respect of such Transaction that is greater than the Initial Stock Loan Rate;

(b) For the purpose of determining the consequence of an Additional Disruption Event:

 (i) If "Change in Law" or "Insolvency Filing" is specified in the related Confirmation to be applicable to a Transaction, then upon the occurrence of such an event either party may elect to terminate the Transaction upon at least two Scheduled Trading Days' notice to the other party specifying the date of such termination (or such lesser notice as may be required to comply with the Change in Law), in which event the Transaction will terminate and the Determining Party will determine the Cancellation Amount payable by one party to the other.

 (ii) If "Failure to Deliver" is specified in the related Confirmation to be applicable to a Transaction, then such event shall not constitute an Event of Default under the ISDA Master Agreement, but upon the occurrence of such an event, the party required to deliver the relevant Shares (the "Delivering Party") shall (A) give the other party (the "Receiving Party") notice that a Failure to Deliver has occurred within one Clearance System Business Day of the relevant Exercise Date in the case of an Option Transaction and at least one Settlement Cycle prior to the Settlement Date in the case of a Forward Transaction or Equity Swap Transaction and (B) deliver on the Settlement Date to the Receiving Party such number of Shares that it can deliver on such date. The Receiving Party's obligation to make any corresponding payment or delivery to the Delivering Party shall be reduced in proportion to the number of Shares it receives from the Delivering Party. In respect of a European Option or a Forward Transaction, the Receiving Party may then elect to terminate the Transaction by giving notice to the Delivering Party and the Transaction will terminate on the date that such notice is effective. The Receiving Party (who shall be the Determining Party) shall determine the Cancellation Amount payable in relation to such terminated Transaction (after consideration of any partial delivery). In respect of an American Option or a Bermuda Option, the Receiving Party may then elect to terminate that part of the Transaction consisting of the exercised Options by giving notice to the Delivering Party. On the date that such notice is effective, a Transaction consisting of the exercised Options only shall be terminated and the Receiving Party (who shall be the Determining Party) shall determine the Cancellation Amount payable in relation to such terminated Transaction (after consideration of any partial delivery). In respect of an Equity Swap Transaction, the Receiving Party may then elect to terminate that part of the Transaction consisting of the Number of Shares to be Delivered or Number of Baskets to be Delivered, as the case may be, on that Settlement Date by giving notice to the Delivering Party. On the date that such notice is effective, a Transaction consisting of the Number of Shares to be Delivered or Number of Baskets to be Delivered, as the case may be, on that Settlement Date only shall be deemed to have been terminated on such Settlement Date and the Receiving Party (who shall be the Determining Party) shall determine the Cancellation Amount payable in relation to such terminated Transaction (after consideration of any partial delivery). In respect of an American Option or a Bermuda Option, in each case to which Multiple Exercise is applicable and upon which less than all Options have been exercised or deemed exercised on the relevant Exercise Date, or in respect of an Equity Swap Transaction in relation to which one or more Settlement Dates have not occurred, the Receiving Party may elect within one Settlement Cycle of the Settlement Date on which the Transaction was partially terminated to terminate the remaining Transaction upon two Scheduled Trading Days' notice to the Delivering Party, in which event the Transaction shall terminate on the date that such notice is effective and the Receiving Party (who shall be the Determining Party) shall determine the Cancellation Amount payable in relation to such terminated Transaction.

 (iii) If "Hedging Disruption" is specified in the related Confirmation to be applicable to a Transaction, then upon the occurrence of such an event the Hedging Party may elect, while the Hedging Disruption is continuing, to terminate the Transaction, upon at least two Scheduled Trading Days' notice to the Non-Hedging Party specifying the date of such termination, in which event the Determining Party will determine the Cancellation Amount payable by one party to the other.

 (iv) If "Loss of Stock Borrow" is specified in the related Confirmation to be applicable to a Transaction, then upon the occurrence of such an event the Hedging Party may give notice that a Loss of Stock Borrow has occurred to the Non-Hedging Party, who may (A) lend the Hedging Party, subject to the conditions below, Shares in an amount equal to the Hedging Shares at a rate equal to or less than the Maximum Stock Loan Rate or (B) refer the Hedging Party to a Lending Party that will lend the Hedging Party Shares in an amount equal to the Hedging Shares at a rate equal to or less than the Maximum Stock Loan Rate, in each case within two Scheduled Trading Days of receipt of the notice of Loss of Stock Borrow. If neither the Non-Hedging Party nor the Lending Party lends Shares in the amount of the Hedging Shares or a satisfactory Lending Party is not identified within this period, the Hedging Party may give notice that it elects to terminate the Transaction, specifying the date of such termination, which may be the same day that the notice of termination is effective. The Determining Party will then determine the Cancellation Amount payable by one party to the other.

 (v) If "Increased Cost of Stock Borrow" is specified in the related Confirmation to be applicable to a Transaction, then upon the occurrence of such an event the Hedging Party will give prompt notice to the Non-Hedging Party that an Increased Cost of Stock Borrow has occurred and that a Price Adjustment will be made to the Transaction. The Non-Hedging Party shall, within two Scheduled Trading Days of receipt of the notice of Increased Cost of Stock Borrow and corresponding Price Adjustment, notify the Hedging Party that it elects to (A) agree to amend the relevant Transaction to take into account the Price Adjustment, (B) pay the Hedging Party an amount determined by the Calculation Agent that corresponds to the Price Adjustment or (C) terminate the Transaction as of that second Scheduled Trading Day. If such notice is not given by the end of that second Scheduled Trading Day, then the Hedging Party may give notice that it elects to terminate the Transaction, specifying the date of such termination, which may be the same day that the notice of termination is effective. If either party elects to terminate the Transaction, the Determining Party will determine the Cancellation Amount payable by one party to the other. Within this period, the Non-Hedging Party may, in order to avoid a Price Adjustment or termination with respect to the Transaction, (X) lend the Hedging Party, subject to the conditions below, Shares in an amount equal to the Hedging Shares at a rate equal to or less than the Initial Stock Loan Rate or (Y) refer the Hedging Party to a Lending Party that lends the Hedging Party Shares in an amount equal to the Hedging Shares at a rate equal to or less than the Initial Stock Loan Rate.

 (vi) If "Increased Cost of Hedging" is specified in the related Confirmation to be applicable to a Transaction, then upon the occurrence of such an event the Hedging Party will give prompt notice to the Non-Hedging Party that such increased costs have been incurred and that a Price Adjustment will be made to the Transaction. The Non-Hedging Party shall, within two Scheduled Trading Days of receipt of the notice of Increased Cost of Hedging and corresponding Price Adjustment, notify the Hedging Party that it elects to (A) agree to amend the relevant Transaction to take into account the Price Adjustment, (B) pay the Hedging Party an amount determined by the Calculation Agent that corresponds to the Price Adjustment or (C) terminate the Transaction as of that second Scheduled Trading Day. If such notice is not given by the end of that second Scheduled Trading Day, then the Hedging Party may give notice that it elects to terminate the Transaction, specifying the date of such termination, which may be the same day that the notice of termination is effective. If either party elects to terminate the Transaction, the Determining Party will determine the Cancellation Amount payable by one party to the other.

 (vii) If both "Hedging Disruption" and "Loss of Stock Borrow" are specified to be applicable to a Transaction and an event or circumstance that would otherwise constitute or give rise to a Hedging Disruption also constitutes a Loss of Stock Borrow, it will be treated as a Loss of Stock Borrow and will not constitute a Hedging Disruption.

 (viii) Any Shares provided by the Non-Hedging Party or the Lending Party, as the case may be, in respect of a Loss of Stock Borrow or Increased Cost of Stock Borrow shall be in book-entry form and freely tradable without any restrictions under relevant law and the lending of such Shares shall be documented under documentation acceptable to the Hedging Party.

 (ix) Any Cancellation Amount payable by one party to the other shall be paid by the party to pay such amount not later than three Currency Business Days following the date that notice of the determination by the Determining Party of such amount (denominated in the currency for settlement of the Transaction as determined by the Determining Party) and the party to pay such amount is effective, which notice shall be provided promptly following such determination.
