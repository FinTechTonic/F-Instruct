published on 19 July 2013 by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.

The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (**ISDA**) has published this ISDA 2013 EMIR Portfolio Reconciliation, Dispute Resolution and Disclosure Protocol (this **Protocol**) to enable parties to Protocol Covered Agreements (as defined in paragraph 4 below) to amend the terms of each such Protocol Covered Agreement to reflect certain portfolio reconciliation and dispute resolution obligations imposed by Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (**EMIR**) and to include certain confidentiality waivers relating to reporting and record keeping obligations under EMIR.

Accordingly, a party that has entered into a Protocol Covered Agreement may adhere to this Protocol and be bound by its terms by completing and delivering a letter substantially in the form of Exhibit 1 to this Protocol (an **Adherence Letter**) to ISDA, as agent, as described below.

### **1. Adherence to and Effectiveness of the Protocol**

- (a) By adhering to this Protocol in the manner set forth in this paragraph 1, a party (an **Adhering Party**) that wishes to amend the terms of a Protocol Covered Agreement, in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Protocol and the relevant Adherence Letter, agrees that the terms of each Protocol Covered Agreement, if any, between it and each other Adhering Party will be amended with effect from the Implementation Date (as defined in subparagraph 1(c) below) in accordance with the terms of the Attachment hereto.
- (b) Adherence to this Protocol will be evidenced by the execution and online delivery, in accordance with this paragraph, to ISDA, as agent, of an Adherence Letter (in accordance with subparagraphs 1(b)(i) through 1(b)(iii) below). ISDA shall have the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, upon thirty calendar days' notice on the "ISDA 2013 EMIR Portfolio Reconciliation, Dispute Resolution and Disclosure Protocol" section of its website at [www.isda.org](http://www.isda.org/) (or by other suitable means) to designate a closing date of this Protocol (such closing date, the **Cut-off Date**). After the Cut-off Date, ISDA will not accept any further Adherence Letters to this Protocol.
	- (i) Each Adhering Party will access the Protocol Management section of the ISDA website at [www.isda.org](http://www.isda.org/) to enter information online that is required to generate its form of Adherence Letter. Either by directly downloading the populated Adherence Letter from the Protocol Management system or upon receipt via e-mail of the populated Adherence Letter, each Adhering Party will print, sign and upload the signed Adherence Letter as a PDF (portable document format) attachment into the Protocol Management system. Once the signed Adherence Letter has been approved and accepted by ISDA, the Adhering

Party will receive an e-mail confirmation of the Adhering Party's adherence to the Protocol.

- (ii) A conformed copy of each Adherence Letter containing, in place of each signature, the printed or typewritten name of each signatory will be published by ISDA so that it may be viewed by all Adhering Parties. Each Adhering Party agrees that, for evidentiary purposes, a conformed copy of an Adherence Letter certified by the General Counsel (or other appropriate officer) of ISDA will be deemed to be an original.
- (iii) Each Adhering Party agrees that the determination of the date and time of acceptance of any Adherence Letter will be determined by ISDA in its absolute discretion.
- (c) As between any two Adhering Parties, the agreement to make the amendments contemplated by this Protocol, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Protocol, will be effective on the date of acceptance by ISDA, as agent, of an Adherence Letter (in accordance with paragraph 1(b) above) from the later of such two Adhering Parties to adhere (such date with respect to such Adhering Parties, the **Implementation Date**). Acceptance by ISDA of a subsequent or revised Adherence Letter from either such Adhering Party will not have the effect of changing such Implementation Date.
- (d) This Protocol is intended for use without negotiation, but without prejudice to any amendment, modification or waiver in respect of a Protocol Covered Agreement that the parties may otherwise effect in accordance with the terms of that Protocol Covered Agreement.
	- (i) In adhering to this Protocol, an Adhering Party may not specify additional provisions, conditions or limitations in its Adherence Letter.
	- (ii) Any purported adherence that ISDA, as agent, determines in good faith is not in compliance with this Protocol will be void and ISDA will inform the relevant party of such fact as soon as reasonably possible after making such determination.
- (e) Each Adhering Party acknowledges and agrees that adherence to this Protocol is irrevocable, except that an Adhering Party may deliver to ISDA, as agent, a notice substantially in the form of Exhibit 2 to this Protocol that is effective (determined pursuant to paragraph 3(e) below) on any Business Day during the Annual Revocation Period (a **Revocation Notice**) to designate the next Annual Revocation Date as the last date on which any counterparty may adhere to this Protocol in respect of any ISDA Master Agreement or Other Agreement between the counterparty and such Adhering Party.
	- (i) Upon the effective designation of the next Annual Revocation Date by an Adhering Party, this Protocol will not amend any ISDA Master Agreement or Other Agreement between that Adhering Party and a party which adheres to this Protocol after that Annual Revocation Date occurs and such ISDA Master Agreement or Other Agreement will not be a Protocol Covered Agreement. The foregoing is without prejudice to any amendment effected pursuant to this Protocol to any Protocol Covered Agreement between two Adhering Parties that each adhered to this Protocol on or before the day on which that Annual Revocation Date occurs or is deemed to occur, regardless of the date on which such Protocol Covered Agreement is entered into, and any such amendment shall be

effective notwithstanding the occurrence or deemed occurrence of such Annual Revocation Date.

- (ii) Each Revocation Notice must be delivered by the means specified in paragraph 3(e) of this Protocol below.
- (iii) Each Adhering Party agrees that, for evidentiary purposes, a conformed copy of a Revocation Notice certified by the General Counsel or an appropriate officer of ISDA will be deemed to be an original.
- (iv) Any purported revocation that ISDA, as agent, determines in good faith is not in compliance with this paragraph 1(e) will be void.

### **2. Representations and Undertakings**

If you are an Agent and act on behalf of multiple Clients, you may sign the Adherence Letter using one of the options below.

If you are able to do so, you may, if you wish, identify Clients by using both names and specific identifiers but this optional and, provided you supply, at least, either names or specific identifiers, choosing not to provide both does not affect the legal validity and binding nature of this Protocol.

### **ATTACHMENT**

With effect from the Implementation Date, each Protocol Covered Agreement shall be modified as follows.

The following text shall be added to the Protocol Covered Agreement:

### **Part I. Portfolio Reconciliation and Dispute Resolution**

### **(1) Agreement to Reconcile Portfolio Data**

The parties agree to reconcile portfolios as required by the Portfolio Reconciliation Risk Mitigation Techniques.

(a) **One-way Delivery of Portfolio Data.** If one party is a Portfolio Data Sending Entity and the other party is a Portfolio Data Receiving Entity:

(i) on each Data Delivery Date, the Portfolio Data Sending Entity will provide Portfolio Data to the Portfolio Data Receiving Entity;

(ii) on each PR Due Date, the Portfolio Data Receiving Entity will perform a Data Reconciliation;

(iii) if the Portfolio Data Receiving Entity identifies one or more discrepancies which such party determines, acting reasonably and in good faith, are material to the rights and obligations of the parties in respect of one or more Relevant Transaction(s), it will notify the other party in writing as soon as reasonably practicable and the parties will consult with each other in an attempt to resolve such discrepancies in a timely fashion for so long as such discrepancies remain outstanding, using, without limitation, any applicable updated reconciliation data produced during the period in which such discrepancy remains outstanding; and

(iv) if the Portfolio Data Receiving Entity does not notify the Portfolio Data Sending Entity that the Portfolio Data contains discrepancies by 4p.m. local time in the place of business of the Portfolio Data Sending Entity on the fifth Joint Business Day following the later of the PR Due Date and the date on which the Portfolio Data Sending Entity provided such Portfolio Data to the Portfolio Data Receiving Entity, the Portfolio Data Receiving Entity will be deemed to have affirmed such Portfolio Data.

(b) **Exchange of Portfolio Data**. If both parties are Portfolio Data Sending Entities:

(i) on each Data Delivery Date, each party will provide Portfolio Data to the other party;

(ii) on each PR Due Date, each party will perform a Data Reconciliation; and

(iii) if a party identifies one or more discrepancies which such party determines, acting reasonably and in good faith, are material to the rights and obligations of the parties in respect of one or more Relevant Transaction(s), it will notify the other party in writing as soon as reasonably practicable and the parties will consult with each other in an attempt to resolve any such discrepancies in a timely fashion for so long as such discrepancies remain outstanding, using, without limitation, any applicable updated reconciliation data produced during the period in which such discrepancy remains outstanding.

(c) **Alternate Process.** If both parties are Portfolio Data Receiving Entities, the parties will agree a process for reconciling Portfolio Data in order to meet the requirements of the Portfolio Reconciliation Risk Mitigation Techniques.

## **(2) Change of Status**

(a) Each party may change its own designation with the written agreement of the other party (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and for this purpose the parties agree, without limitation, that it will not be unreasonable for a party to withhold agreement where agreement would result in the other party having different designations in respect of such party and one or more Affiliates of such party). If, as a result of any such change of designation, both parties will be Portfolio Data Receiving Entities, Part I(1)(c) will apply.

(b) If a party believes, acting reasonably and in good faith, that the parties are required to perform Data Reconciliation at a greater or lesser frequency than that being used by the parties at such time, it will notify the other party of such in writing, providing evidence on request. From the date such notice is effectively delivered, such greater or lesser frequency will apply and the first following PR Due Date will be the earlier of the date agreed between the parties and the last Joint Business Day in the PR Period starting on the date on which the immediately preceding Data Reconciliation occurred (or, if no Joint Business Day occurs which is within such PR Period and is on or following the date such notice is effective, the first Joint Business Day following the later of the end of such PR Period and the date such notice is effective).

### **(3) Use of agents and third party service providers**

For the purposes of performing all or part of the actions under Parts I(1) and I(2), each party may appoint:

(a) an Affiliate to act as agent, immediately on written notice to the other party (including, without limitation, by naming the Affiliate as agent in such party's Adherence Letter); and/or

(b) subject to the other party's agreement (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and which may include any such agreement existing prior to the Implementation Date (as defined in the Protocol)), (i) an entity other than an Affiliate as agent and/or (ii) a qualified and duly mandated third party service provider.

A party may indicate that it may use a third party service provider in its Adherence Letter.

## **(4) Dispute Identification and Resolution Procedure**

The parties agree that they will use the following procedure to identify and resolve Disputes between them:

(a) either party may identify a Dispute by sending a Dispute Notice to the other party;

(b) on or following the Dispute Date, the parties will consult in good faith in an attempt to resolve the Dispute in a timely manner, including, without limitation, by exchanging any relevant information and by identifying and using any Agreed Process which can be applied to the subject of the Dispute or, where no such Agreed Process exists or the parties agree that such Agreed Process would be unsuitable, determining and applying a resolution method for the Dispute; and

(c) with respect to any Dispute that is not resolved within five Joint Business Days of the Dispute Date, refer issues internally to appropriately senior members of staff of such party or of its Affiliate, adviser or agent in addition to actions under (b) immediately above (including actions under any Agreed Process identified and used under (b) immediately above) and to the extent such referral has not occurred as a result of action under (b) immediately above (including any Agreed Process).

## **(5) Internal processes for recording and monitoring Disputes**

Each party agrees that, to the extent the Dispute Resolution Risk Mitigation Techniques apply to each party, it will have internal procedures and processes in place to record and monitor any Dispute for as long as the Dispute remains outstanding.

### **(6) Relationship to other portfolio reconciliation and dispute resolution processes**

This Part I and any action or inaction of either party in respect of it are without prejudice to any rights or obligations the parties may possess in respect of each other under any Agreed Process or other contractual agreement, by operation of law or otherwise. Action or inaction by a party in respect of this Part I will not be presumed to operate as an exercise or waiver, in whole or part, of any right, power or privilege such party may possess in respect of each other under any Agreed Process or other contractual agreement, by operation of law or otherwise. In particular, but without limitation, (a) any valuation in respect of one or more Relevant Transactions for the purposes of this Part I will be without prejudice to any other valuation with respect to such Relevant Transaction(s) made for collateral, close out, dispute or other purpose; (b) the parties may seek to identify and resolve issues and discrepancies between themselves before either party delivers a Dispute Notice; and (c) nothing in this Part I obliges a party to deliver a Dispute Notice following the identification of any such issue or discrepancy (notwithstanding that such issue or discrepancy may remain unresolved) or limits the rights of the parties to serve a Dispute Notice, to commence or continue an Agreed Process (whether or not any action under Part I(4) has occurred) or otherwise to pursue any dispute resolution process in respect of any such issue or discrepancy (whether or not any action under Part I(4) has occurred).

## **Part II Confidentiality Waiver**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement or in any non-disclosure, confidentiality or other agreement between the parties, each party hereby consents to the disclosure of information:

(1) to the extent required or permitted under, or made in accordance with, the provisions of EMIR and any applicable supporting law, rule or regulation (*"EMIR and Supporting Regulation"*) which mandate reporting and/or retention of transaction and similar information or to the extent required or permitted under, or made in accordance with, any order or directive in relation to (and including) EMIR and Supporting Regulation regarding reporting and/or retention of transaction and similar information issued by any authority or body or agency in accordance with which the other party is required or accustomed to act (*"Reporting Requirements"*); or

(2) to and between the other party's head office, branches or Affiliates, or any persons or entities who provide services to such other party or its head office, branches or Affiliates, in each case, in connection with such Reporting Requirements.

Each party acknowledges that pursuant to EMIR and Supporting Regulation, regulators require reporting of trade data to increase market transparency and enable regulators to monitor systemic risk to ensure safeguards are implemented globally.

Each party further acknowledges that disclosures made pursuant hereto may include, without limitation, the disclosure of trade information including a party's identity (by name, address, corporate affiliation, identifier or otherwise) to any trade repository registered in accordance with Article 55 of EMIR or recognised in accordance with Article 77 of EMIR or one or more systems or services operated by any such trade repository (*"TR"*) and any relevant regulators (including without limitation, the European Securities and Markets Authority and national regulators in the European Union) under EMIR and Supporting Regulation and that such disclosures could result in certain anonymous transaction and pricing data becoming available to the public. Each party further acknowledges that, for purposes of complying with regulatory reporting obligations, a party may use a third party service provider to transfer trade information into a TR and that a TR may engage the services of a global trade repository regulated by one or more governmental regulators. Each party also acknowledges that disclosures made pursuant hereto may be made to recipients in a jurisdiction other than that of the disclosing party or a jurisdiction that may not necessarily provide an equivalent or adequate level of protection for personal data as the counterparty's home jurisdiction. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) to the extent that applicable nondisclosure, confidentiality, bank secrecy, data privacy or other law imposes non-disclosure requirements on transaction and similar information required or permitted to be disclosed as contemplated herein but permits a party to waive such requirements by consent, the consent and acknowledgements provided herein shall be a consent by each party for purposes of such law; (ii) any agreement between the parties to maintain confidentiality of information contained in this agreement or in any non-disclosure, confidentiality or other agreement shall continue to apply to the extent that such agreement is not inconsistent with the disclosure of information in connection with the Reporting Requirements as set out herein; and (iii) nothing herein is intended to limit the scope of any other consent to disclosure separately given by each party to the other party.

The consenting party represents and warrants that any third party to whom it owes a duty of confidence in respect of the information disclosed has consented to the disclosure of that information.
