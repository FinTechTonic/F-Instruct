# **INTRODUCTION TO THE 2011 EQUITY DERIVATIVES DEFINITIONS**

The 2011 ISDA Equity Derivatives Definitions (the "**2011 Definitions**") are intended for use in confirmations of individual equity derivative transactions governed by agreements such as the ISDA 1992 Master Agreement, the ISDA 2002 Master Agreement, or any successor to them, published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ("**ISDA**"). Copies of ISDA Master Agreements and other ISDA published documents are available from the executive offices of ISDA and on the ISDA website (*www.isda.org*).

The 2011 Definitions revise and expand the 2002 ISDA Equity Derivatives Definitions (the "**2002 Definitions**"). The 2011 Definitions can be incorporated into future confirmations and other documents but existing confirmations and other documents that incorporate the 1996 ISDA Equity Derivatives Definitions (the "**1996 Definitions**") or the 2002 Definitions will not, without further action by the parties, be affected by the publication of the 2011 Definitions or their use for subsequent transactions. Neither the publication nor the use of the 2011 Definitions to document a transaction is intended to alter the construction or interpretation of any provision of the 1996 Definitions or the 2002 Definitions.

The purpose of the 2011 Definitions is to provide the basic framework for the documentation of privately negotiated equity derivative transactions. As with other product-specific definitions published by ISDA, parties using the 2011 Definitions to document a privately negotiated equity derivative transaction may adapt or supplement the standard provisions set out in the 2011 Definitions to reflect the specific terms agreed between the parties for that particular transaction.

ISDA has provided the 2011 Definitions to assist with the smooth and efficient functioning of the privately negotiated equity derivatives markets by providing a common set of terms for parties to use in preparing documentation. *However, the precise documentation of each individual transaction remains the responsibility of the parties concerned. ISDA does not assume any responsibility for any use to which the 2011 Definitions may be put, including any use of the 2011 Definitions in connection with any privately negotiated derivative transaction. Each party to a transaction evidenced by a confirmation or other document referring to or incorporating the 2011 Definitions must satisfy itself that the 2011 Definitions are appropriate for the transaction, have been properly used and/or adapted in that confirmation or other document and that the confirmation or other document has generally been properly drafted, in each case, to reflect the commercial intentions of the parties. In particular, parties should be aware that the 2011 Definitions contain definitions relating to terms and concepts that are not anticipated to be fully utilized unless and until the 2011 Definitions are further supplemented. If parties choose to enter into equity derivative transactions relating to any of these terms and concepts using the 2011 Definitions before they are supplemented, they must take particular care to assure themselves that the 2011 Definitions have been properly adapted for such use.*

ISDA has not undertaken to review any applicable laws and regulations of any jurisdiction in which the 2011 Definitions may be used or of any jurisdiction whose laws or regulations affect derivatives contracts, indices, securities and/or currencies that may be the subject of a privately negotiated equity derivative transaction. Parties are therefore advised to consider the application of any relevant jurisdiction's regulatory, tax, accounting, exchange or other requirements that may exist in connection with entering into and using the 2011 Definitions to document such a transaction.

This introduction is not part of the 2011 Definitions and is not offered as an interpretation of the 2011 Definitions.

#### **2011 ISDA EQUITY DERIVATIVES DEFINITIONS**

Any or all of the definitions and provisions of the 2011 Definitions may be incorporated into a document (including in electronic form) by indicating in the document that, or the extent to which, the document is subject to the 2011 Definitions. Where the Parties incorporate the 2011 Definitions in the Confirmation for an ED Transaction, unless the Confirmation states otherwise, the versions of the Main Book and the Appendix constituting the 2011 Definitions so incorporated shall be the most recent versions published as of the calendar day immediately prior to the Trade Date of that ED Transaction. If the Parties wish to exclude one or more amendments or supplements introduced in the most recent version of the Main Book and/or the Appendix or any earlier version, they may either specify in the Confirmation the provision, amendment or supplement they wish to exclude or specify the specific version of the Main Book and/or the Appendix they wish to apply for the purposes of that ED Transaction. All definitions and provisions so incorporated in a document relating to an ED Transaction will apply to that document and that ED Transaction unless otherwise provided in that document.

In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of the Appendix and the Main Book incorporated in a document relating to an ED Transaction, the terms set out in the Appendix will govern.

Any term used in a document that incorporates the 2011 Definitions will, when combined with the name of a Party or a definition relating to a Party, have a meaning in respect of the named or defined Party only.

#### 20.10.2 **Methods of Determining Cancellation Amount.**

- (i) *Agreed Formula.* If Agreed Formula is Specified, the Cancellation Amount will be determined in accordance with the Agreed Formula.
- (ii) *Calculation Agent Valuation.* If *Calculation Agent Valuation* is Specified, the Calculation Agent shall, using commercially reasonable procedures in order to produce a commercially reasonable result, determine the Cancellation Amount. The Cancellation Amount will be equal to the ED Transaction Value, as may be adjusted in accordance with Section 20.10.5 (*Allocation of Hedge Close-out Gains/Losses*). In making such a determination, the Calculation Agent may consider Section 20.10.3 (*Time of Determination*), Section 20.10.4 (*Relevant Data Inputs*) and any other information it considers to be relevant, including the types of information described in the most appropriate "Agreed Formula" of the Agreed Formulae set out in the Appendix for the ED Transaction.
- (iii) *CA Determining Party Determination*. If *CA Determining Party Determination* is Specified, subject to Section 20.10.6 (*Consequences of*

*a Hedging Party Event*), the Cancellation Amount will be an amount determined as follows:

- (a) If there is only one CA Determining Party, the CA Determining Party will determine the ED Transaction Value:

and, in each case, that ED Transaction Value will be adjusted in accordance with Section 20.10.5 (*Allocation of Hedge Closeout Gains/Losses*). Each CA Determining Party shall promptly give notice in writing of its determination to the Calculation Agent. The Cancellation Amount will be the amount determined by the Calculation Agent to be equal to the arithmetic mean of the CA Determining Parties' determinations; provided that if the CA Determining Parties determine that different Parties are required to pay the Cancellation Amount, then the Cancellation Amount will be the amount determined by the Calculation Agent to be equal to the absolute value of the result of one-half of the difference between those determinations and will be payable by the Party determined by the Calculation Agent as the payer of what would be the higher Cancellation Amount.

- (iv) If:
	- (a) the Disputing Party is either (I) the sole Affected Party in relation to a Termination Event that has occurred and is continuing in relation to all Transactions under the Relevant ISDA Master Agreement or (II) the Defaulting Party in relation to an Event of Default that has occurred and is continuing, but in each case no Early Termination Date has been designated or has occurred;
	- (b) the Disputing Party is the OD Owing Party; and
	- (c) *Disregard Default Payment/Delivery Obligations* has not been Specified,

then:

- (x) if there is or, upon initiation of the Calculation Dispute Resolution Procedure, would be a Disputed Amount, the Disputing Party shall not have the right to initiate or continue, as the case may be, the Calculation Dispute Resolution Procedure unless it has paid and/or delivered all amounts determined to be owed by it in accordance with the Original Determination (including any Disputed Amount); and
- (y) *Payment/Delivery of Original Amount* shall be deemed to be Specified.

If the Disputing Party fails to pay and/or deliver all amounts determined to be owed by it in accordance with the Original Determination (including any Disputed Amount) on or prior to the relevant Original Due Date or, if such Original Due Date is prior to the Effective date of the notice of such Event of Default or Termination Event, on or prior to the date falling one Currency Business Day (in the case of payments) or one Settlement Cycle (in the case of deliveries) after the Effective date of that notice, any Calculation Dispute Resolution Procedure initiated by such Disputing Party that has not been completed shall cease and the relevant Original Determination shall be binding on the Parties.

- 22.1.3 **Negotiated Resolution.** If a Disputing Party has initiated a Calculation Dispute Resolution Procedure in accordance with Section 22.1.1 (*Initiation of the Calculation Dispute Resolution Procedure*), the Parties shall, in good faith, attempt to resolve such dispute promptly. If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute on or prior to the Party Resolution Deadline, Section 22.2 (*Resolution Processes*) shall apply.
- 22.1.4 **Payment/Delivery Obligations of the Parties during the Calculation Dispute Resolution Procedure.** The payment and/or delivery obligations of the Parties

shall be determined in accordance with the Specified Dispute Resolution Payment Election:

- (i) If *Payment/Delivery of Undisputed Amount Only* is Specified, then any Undisputed Amount shall be paid and/or delivered by each OD Owing Party to the relevant OD Receiving Party on the relevant Original Due Date.
- (ii) If *Payment/Delivery of Original Amount* is Specified, then any payment and/or delivery determined to be owed by each OD Owing Party to the relevant OD Receiving Party in accordance with the Original Determination shall be paid and/or delivered by that OD Owing Party to that OD Receiving Party on the relevant Original Due Date.
- (iii) If *Payment/Delivery of Half Disputed Amount* is Specified, then (a) any Undisputed Amount and (b) one half of any Disputed Amount shall be paid and/or delivered by each OD Owing Party to the relevant OD Receiving Party on the relevant Original Due Date.
- (iv) If *Escrow of Disputed Amount* is Specified, then:
	- (a) if a Dispute Resolution Escrow Account has been established prior to the relevant Original Due Date (I) any Undisputed Amount shall be paid and/or delivered by each OD Owing Party to the relevant OD Receiving Party and (II) any Disputed Amount shall be paid and/or delivered by each OD Owing Party into such Dispute Resolution Escrow Account, in each case, on the relevant Original Due Date; or
	- (b) if a Dispute Resolution Escrow Account has not been established prior to the relevant Original Due Date, payments and/or deliveries shall be made in accordance with the Escrow of Disputed Amount Alternative Election.

The Parties will act in good faith and use commercially reasonable endeavors to establish a Dispute Resolution Escrow Account into which payment and/or delivery of any Disputed Amounts can be made. If a Dispute Resolution Escrow Account is established after a payment and/or delivery has been made in accordance with Sub-section (b) above, but prior to the resolution of the relevant dispute, the Parties shall make such payments and/or deliveries so as to replicate the position contemplated by Sub-section (a) above.

- (v) "**Disputed Amount**" means, in relation to any amount that is payable or deliverable by a Party and the subject of a Calculation Dispute Resolution Procedure, an amount payable or deliverable by the OD Owing Party equal to:

	- (b) if the Original Determination and the Disputing Party Determination relating to such amount result in different Parties being the Owed Party, zero.
- (vii) Unless *Payment/Delivery of Original Amount* or *Payment/Delivery of Half Disputed Amount* is Specified, the failure by a Party to pay and/or deliver when due any Disputed Amount or half of any Disputed Amount, as the case may be, that is the subject of an ongoing dispute to which a Calculation Dispute Resolution Procedure applies will not, unless Section 22.1.2(iv) (*Restrictions on the Operation of the Calculation Dispute Resolution Procedure*) applies, constitute a "Failure to Pay or Deliver" under the Relevant ISDA Master Agreement for as long as such procedure is being carried out.
- 22.1.5 **Withdrawal of a Dispute.** A Disputing Party may withdraw a dispute in relation to which it has initiated a Calculation Dispute Resolution Procedure at any time on or prior to the Selection Deadline by notifying the other Party in writing that it is doing so.

	- (b) shall neither (I) communicate the economic terms of such ED Transaction, the Original Determination or the Disputing Party Determination nor (II) solicit in advance any indication of the calculation or determination that would be made by the prospective Dispute Resolution Calculation Agent or of any material input to its calculation or determination. Any discussions between such Party and the prospective Dispute Resolution Calculation Agent regarding existing or new transactions between such Party and the prospective Dispute Resolution Calculation Agent will not be considered such a solicitation.
- (iv) If each Party appoints two Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents and no Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents are appointed in common, the Calculation Dispute Resolution Procedure will proceed with the four Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents that have been appointed.
- (v) If each Party appoints a Dispute Resolution Calculation Agent in common and there are three Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents appointed in total, then the Calculation Dispute Resolution Procedure will proceed with the three Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents that have been appointed.
- (vi) If either:
	- (a) each Party appoints one Dispute Resolution Calculation Agent in common, but there are fewer than three Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents appointed in total; or
	- (b) both Parties appoint the same two Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents,

then:

- (x) the Selection Deadline will be extended by two Reference Days; and
- (y) each Party that has not appointed at least one Dispute Resolution Calculation Agent not also appointed by the other Party may appoint one additional Independent Dealer to act as a Dispute Resolution Calculation Agent in the manner provided in this Section 22.2.1.

If, following the application of the process described above, the Parties have appointed a total number of Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents that is:

- (1) in the case of a dispute where *Dealer Poll* is Specified and that relates to a determination that is susceptible to the determination of an arithmetic mean, equal to or greater than the Minimum Number of Responders; or
- (2) in any other case, equal to or greater than two,

the Calculation Dispute Resolution Procedure will proceed with the Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents so appointed. Otherwise, the Calculation Dispute Resolution Procedure shall cease and the Original Determination shall be binding on the Parties.

#### (vii) If the Parties have:

	- (c) provide details of the determinations referred to in Subsection (a) and/or (b) above, as the case may be, to each Party (or the Dispute Agent, if one has been appointed).
- (ii) Regardless of how many Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents are appointed by the Parties (or the Dispute Agent on their behalf), if two or more of the Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents determine that the Original Determination was not commercially reasonable (a "**Determination of Unreasonableness**"), then the dispute will be determined as provided in Section 22.4 (*Determination of the Resolved Amount*).

In any other case, the Original Determination shall be binding on the Parties and Section 22.4 (*Determination of the Resolved Amount*) shall not apply.

- (iii) If the dispute is to be determined in accordance with Section 22.4 (*Determination of the Resolved Amount*), any Dispute Resolution Calculation Agent that determined that the Original Determination was commercially reasonable shall, for the purposes of Section 22.4 (*Determination of the Resolved Amount*), be deemed to have provided an Alternative Determination that is the same as the Original Determination.
- 22.3.2 **Dealer Poll.** If *Dealer Poll* is Specified, each Dispute Resolution Calculation Agent shall, on or prior to the Determination Deadline:
	- (i) make an Alternative Determination; and
	- (ii) provide such Alternative Determination to each Party (or the Dispute Agent, if one has been appointed).

The dispute will then be determined as provided in Section 22.4 (*Determination of the Resolved Amount*).

#### **Section 22.4 Determination of the Resolved Amount.**

If this Section 22.4 applies, the dispute will be determined as follows:

- 22.4.1 **Insufficient Number of Alternative Determinations.** If the number of Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents that provide an Alternative Determination to each Party (or the Dispute Agent, if one has been appointed) on or prior to the Determination Deadline is either (a) in the case of an Arithmetic Mean Determination, fewer than the Minimum Number of Responders or (b) in the case of a Non Arithmetic Mean Determination, fewer than two, the Original Determination will be binding on the Parties.
- 22.4.2 **Sufficient Number of Alternative Determinations.** Otherwise, the dispute will be determined as follows:
	- (i) *One Arithmetic Mean Determination and Minimum Number of Responders is one*. If (x) only one Dispute Resolution Calculation Agent provides an Alternative Determination to each Party (or the Dispute Agent, if one has been appointed) on or prior to the Determination Deadline, (y) the Minimum Number of Responders is one and (z) that Alternative Determination is an Arithmetic Mean Determination, that Alternative Determination will be binding on the Parties, absent manifest error.
	- (ii) *Two or more Arithmetic Mean Determinations and no Resolver Determination*. If (x) two or more Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents provide an Alternative Determination to each Party (or the Dispute Agent, if one has been appointed) on or prior to the Determination Deadline, (y) those Alternative Determinations are Arithmetic Mean Determinations and (z) *Resolver Determination* is not Specified, then:
		- (a) if two Alternative Determinations are so provided, the arithmetic mean of those Alternative Determinations will be binding on the Parties, absent manifest error;
		- (b) if three Alternative Determinations are so provided, the Alternative Determination that is neither the highest nor the lowest Alternative Determination will be binding on the Parties, absent manifest error; and
		- (c) if four Alternative Determinations are so provided, the arithmetic mean of the two Alternative Determinations that are neither the highest nor the lowest Alternative Determination will be binding on the Parties, absent manifest error,

provided that for the purpose of this Section 22.4.2(ii) only, an Alternative Determination will be expressed as (x) a positive number if it would be paid, or result in an amount that would be paid, to the OD Receiving Party or (y) a negative number if it would be paid, or result in an amount that would be paid, by the OD Receiving Party.

(iii) *Two or more Arithmetic Mean Determinations and Resolver Determination*. If (x) two or more Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents provide an Alternative Determination to each Party (or the Dispute Agent, if one has been appointed) on or prior to the Determination Deadline, (y) those Alternative Determinations are Arithmetic Mean Determinations and (z) *Resolver Determination* is Specified, then:

- (a) if all the responding Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents provide the same Alternative Determination, such Alternative Determination will be binding on the Parties, absent manifest error; or
- (b) otherwise, the dispute will be resolved in accordance with Section 22.4.3 (*Resolver Determination*).
- (iv) *Two or more Non Arithmetic Mean Determinations*. If (x) two or more Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents provide an Alternative Determination to each Party (or the Dispute Agent, if one has been appointed) on or prior to the Determination Deadline and (y) those Alternative Determinations are Non Arithmetic Mean Determinations:
	- (a) if the majority of the responding Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents provide the same Alternative Determination, that Alternative Determination will be binding on the Parties, absent manifest error; or
	- (b) otherwise, the dispute will be resolved in accordance with Section 22.4.3 (*Resolver Determination*).
- (v) *Susceptibility to the determination of an arithmetic mean*. The Parties agree that Non Arithmetic Mean Determinations shall include the following:
	- (a) responses as to whether or not an event has occurred; and
	- (b) responses in which different terms of the ED Transaction are proposed to be adjusted.
- (vi) *Multiple highest and/or lowest Alternative Determinations*. If two or more Arithmetic Mean Determinations are the same and are also the highest or lowest Alternative Determinations, then, for the purposes of Sub-sections (ii) and (iii) above, only one of those same Alternative Determinations shall be considered to be the highest or the lowest, as the case may be.
- 22.4.3 **Resolver Determination.** If *Resolver Determination* is Specified and this Section 22.4.3 applies pursuant to Section 22.4.2(iii) (*Two or more Arithmetic Mean Determinations and Resolver Determination*) or Section 22.4.2(iv) (*Two or more Non Arithmetic Mean Determinations*):
	- (i) The responding Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents will act in good faith and use commercially reasonable endeavors to jointly agree and appoint an additional Independent Dealer to resolve the dispute (the "**Resolver**") within one Reference Day of the Determination Deadline.
- (ii) If the responding Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents are successful in appointing a Resolver within one Reference Day of the Determination Deadline, one or more of the responding Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents will, without disclosing to the Resolver the identity of the Parties:
	- (a) provide the Resolver with the Alternative Determinations provided by the responding Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents;
	- (b) request that the Resolver select the most appropriate Alternative Determination from such Alternative Determinations and notify a particular responding Dispute Resolution Calculation Agent of the selected Alternative Determination on or prior to the Resolver Selection Deadline; and
	- (c) promptly notify the Parties (or the Dispute Agent, if one has been appointed) either of the Alternative Determination selected by the Resolver or of the fact that the Resolver has not selected an Alternative Determination on or prior to the Resolver Selection Deadline.

If an Alternative Determination is so selected by the Resolver on or prior to the Resolver Selection Deadline it will be binding on the Parties, absent manifest error.

If an Alternative Determination is not so selected by the Resolver on or prior to the Resolver Selection Deadline, then:

- (x) if the Alternative Determinations provided by the Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents were Arithmetic Mean Determinations, the arithmetic mean of such Alternative Determinations will be binding on the Parties, absent manifest error; or
- (y) in any other case, the Original Determination will be binding on the Parties.
- (iii) If the responding Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents fail to jointly appoint a Resolver within one Reference Day of the Determination Deadline, one or more of the Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents shall so notify the Parties (or the Dispute Agent, if one has been appointed) as soon as practicable on or prior to the second Reference Day following the Determination Deadline, and the Calculation Agent or the Dispute Agent, as the case may be, shall, within one Reference Day of the Effective date of such notice:
	- (a) endeavor to appoint an additional Independent Dealer to act as the Resolver;
	- (b) provide the responding Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents' Alternative Determinations to the Resolver; and
	- (c) request that the Resolver select the most appropriate Alternative Determination from those Alternative Determinations and notify

the Calculation Agent (or the Dispute Agent, if one has been appointed) of the selected Alternative Determination on or prior to the Resolver Selection Deadline.

The Calculation Agent or the Dispute Agent, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the Parties of the Alternative Determination selected by the Resolver or of the fact that the Resolver has not selected an Alternative Determination on or prior to the Resolver Selection Deadline.

If an Alternative Determination is so selected by the Resolver on or prior to the Resolver Selection Deadline, it will be binding on the Parties, absent manifest error.

If an Alternative Determination is not so selected by the Resolver on or prior to the Resolver Selection Deadline or the Calculation Agent or the Dispute Agent, as the case may be, is unable to appoint a Resolver within the timeframe described above, then:

- (x) if the Alternative Determinations provided by the Dispute Resolution Calculation Agents were Arithmetic Mean Determinations, the arithmetic mean of such Alternative Determinations will be binding on the Parties, absent manifest error; or
- (y) in any other case, the Original Determination will be binding on the Parties.
