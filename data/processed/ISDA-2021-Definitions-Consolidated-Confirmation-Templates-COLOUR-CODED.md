### **Introduction**

Version 1 of the 2021 ISDA Interest Rate Derivatives Definitions ("2021 Definitions) was published on June 11, 2021 following a detailed review of the 2006 ISDA Definitions ("2006 Definitions"). While much of what worked well in the 2006 Definitions was retained in the 2021 Definitions, there were areas of change which will require market participants to update their confirmation templates.

The Exhibits to the 2006 Definitions had not been updated since their original publication, notwithstanding that the 2006 Definitions had been amended by means of over 75 supplements. This means that any full blackline shows a very large number of changes which are attributable to those supplements, rather than to the 2021 Definitions. This annotated document does not, therefore, purport to be a full blackline of all changes. Instead, this document highlights and provides comments on changes which are particular to the 2021 Definitions to the extent they were considered potentially helpful to market participants as well as flagging changes resulting from the Overnight Rate Compounding/Averaging provisions which were brought over into the 2021 Definitions from Supplement 75 and Supplement 76 to the 2006 Definitions. In particular,

**New fields that have been introduced by the 2021 Definitions or significant footnotes about something new in 2021 Definitions have been colour coded in - BLUE**

**Changes to something existing in the 2006 Definitions made by the 2021 Definitions - RED**

**Notable additions/changes to template (not due to the 2021 Definitions) - ORANGE**

**Changes due to Supplement 75/76 (Overnight Rate Compounding/Averaging) - GREEN**

Commentary has only been provided to new fields/changes the first time they appear.

<sup>1</sup> By using this language, the parties will incorporate the latest version of the 2021 ISDA Interest Rate Derivatives Definitions ("2021 Definitions") as at the Trade Date of the relevant Transaction. If the parties want to incorporate an earlier version, they should specify the version number of the 2021 Definitions that they wish to incorporate, for example "2021 ISDA Interest Rate Derivatives Definitions version 1.0". Note that the Matrices are versioned separately from the main book. The version of the Matrices that apply is each version as at the Trade Date. If the parties want to incorporate an earlier version of any one of the Matrices they should specify the relevant Matrix and version being incorporated.

<sup>36</sup> Include the appropriate Business Day Convention if that Business Day Convention is to apply to all dates that are stated in the 2021 Definitions to be adjusted in accordance with the applicable Business Day Convention. This is not necessary if Payment Dates and Period End Dates are to be adjusted in accordance with the Modified Following Business Day Convention, as provided in the 2021 Definitions, however parties may prefer to include this for transparency.
